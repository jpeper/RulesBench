        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

In this latter case, all bullet points serve as a reminder of what actions can be useful to accomplish the specified objective\". So for Main Objectives 1 to 5 and Secondary Objectives 1-4, the bullet lists are not ordered by priority. Paragraphs O3.b to O3.d give some guidance on which action to perform, but it's not precise/exhaustive. For the other objective cells, bullet lists are sorted by priority as you said. 4. Don’t know if it is correct but I can tell you that in that situation that is exactly what I do. 5. Yes, correct; this trigger’s occurrence is very low, in my experience as well. 6.

This matters in this example if I were to place on an opponent's Papal States card that already has a bishop. Then for Diet of Worms, if I place both bishops there as one action, do both bishops I place die with the already existing action? Or is each bishop placement its own separate event so I can place one bishop first on the opponent's Papal States, the existing bishop and new bishop die, then I place the second one and it can survive?

The explanation also clarifies that 'dominant religion' is defined for each row of Table O5 in the trigger column and is distinct from 'supreme religion', as defined in the Manual. This aligns with the context of AI triggers in Pax Renaissance Second Edition."

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

Are you allowed to split where the bishops go (e.g., one on Papal States throne, one on the card itself)? Is the placement of both pieces considered one event or is it considered two, one after the other? This matters in this example if I were to place on an opponent's Papal States card that already has a bishop. Then for Diet of Worms, if I place both bishops there as one action, do both bishops I place die with the already existing action? Or is each bishop placement its own separate event so I can place one bishop first on the opponent's Papal States, the existing bishop and new bishop die, then I place the second one and it can survive? On a more general note for the 1st question, other cards that allow placement of 2 or more pieces like a rook and a knight, can I split them and are they separate placements too?",

In Pax Renaissance Second Edition, the location of a card like Michelangelo affects where bishops can be moved, but his special ability is not dependent on the location. For the Inquisition, it works similarly to the Behead action in that bishops can be moved between locations that share a region. Regarding the conspiracy or peasant revolt, when you take control of a republic from an opponent's tableau, it becomes a vassal on the reign side of your tableau, as empire cards always enter on the king side unless a regime change occurs."

Conspiracies, while they can change control of territories, do not inherently remove theocracies based on the religion of the pieces involved. Therefore, the Reformist Theocracy would remain after a conspiracy by Catholic knights, as the removal would require a religious war operation.

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

In this latter case, all bullet points serve as a reminder of what actions can be useful to accomplish the specified objective\". So for Main Objectives 1 to 5 and Secondary Objectives 1-4, the bullet lists are not ordered by priority. Paragraphs O3.b to O3.d give some guidance on which action to perform, but it's not precise/exhaustive. For the other objective cells, bullet lists are sorted by priority as you said. 4. Don’t know if it is correct but I can tell you that in that situation that is exactly what I do. 5. Yes, correct; this trigger’s occurrence is very low, in my experience as well. 6.

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

In this latter case, all bullet points serve as a reminder of what actions can be useful to accomplish the specified objective\". So for Main Objectives 1 to 5 and Secondary Objectives 1-4, the bullet lists are not ordered by priority. Paragraphs O3.b to O3.d give some guidance on which action to perform, but it's not precise/exhaustive. For the other objective cells, bullet lists are sorted by priority as you said. 4. Don’t know if it is correct but I can tell you that in that situation that is exactly what I do. 5. Yes, correct; this trigger’s occurrence is very low, in my experience as well. 6.

Additionally, the low occurrence of certain triggers, such as the Prestige Objectives and the 'less than 3 florins' condition, is consistent with the player's experience.

According to the rules, 'The attacking Tokens are Victorious if they have at least one survivor.' (Battle section).

The presence of a rook does not influence the outcome if all knights are defeated. Therefore, if all attacking knights die, the campaign is not victorious, regardless of the rook's status."

This means that even if you use an ability to activate Eastern Ops without expending an action, you cannot then use another ability to perform both East and West Ops in one action, as this would effectively allow you to perform East Ops twice in one turn, which is not permitted. Therefore, once you have used the 'east ops without expending an action' ability, the 'east & west ops in one action' ability cannot be used to perform East Ops again."

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

This is because the ability does not specify replacing the green unit status, but rather adds additional roles. The rules state that 'Ruling Class in a Theocracy and Pirates Adjacent to a Theocracy count towards religious Supremacy if they are the correct color.' Therefore, the ability likely enhances the pirate's role without removing its original status."

After the battle, 'Place surviving Agents into the empty Cities, repressing for free once the Empire is Saturated.' This indicates that the placement of agents occurs after the battle, and if there are not enough free cities, the Repress is free. This aligns with option c, which states that the battle is resolved first and surviving attackers are placed on empty cities afterwards, with free Repress if needed."

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

In this latter case, all bullet points serve as a reminder of what actions can be useful to accomplish the specified objective\". So for Main Objectives 1 to 5 and Secondary Objectives 1-4, the bullet lists are not ordered by priority. Paragraphs O3.b to O3.d give some guidance on which action to perform, but it's not precise/exhaustive. For the other objective cells, bullet lists are sorted by priority as you said. 4.

The AI's behavior of primarily activating row 6 of table O8 for most of the game, as described in the question, supports this interpretation.

This is consistent with the game's mechanics, where religious dynamics can lead to regime changes. The rules state that a Religious War can be triggered if there are Heretics to kill in the target location (K1c), and the attackers include Ruling Class (Knights & Rooks in that Location, Believers only) (K1a). The Qizilbash, being a jihad, can use Islamic pieces (green) to target non-Islamic pieces (Catholic rook) in a Religious War, leading to a regime change (K2)."

This is consistent with the rules for purchasing market cards: 'The purchase price of a card depends on its current column in the Market. The first faceup Market card costs 1 Florin, the next 2 Florins, then 3 Florins, etc. Pay this cost by placing 1 Florin on each card in the same row to the left of the card you are purchasing.'

The rules state that 'Tokens never move out of their empire as a result of a Battle (even Adjacent Knights used in campaigns or Religious Wars return home after the fight).' This is confirmed in the 'Tip' under the 'Campaign Op Example' on page 25 of the rules. Therefore, in a Jihad in Hungary, you would eliminate 2 of the attackers and the 2 defenders, and the surviving knights would stay in their original country. If the card used for the Jihad has any agent icons on it, and they weren't eliminated as attackers, they would be placed in the empty spaces in Hungary."

Additionally, if none of the kingdoms are owned by the player and all have 1 knight/rook, should the decision be made randomly between all 4? Lastly, how should one choose between a pawn or a knight to be the surviving victor?",

In the context of Pax Renaissance, acquiring a kingdom from the player would not only strengthen the opponent's position but also directly weaken the player's influence and control over the board. This aligns with the strategic goal of reducing the player's power. The reference material does not explicitly mention solo mode strategies, but the general mechanics of the game suggest that weakening an opponent is a valid strategic move. The other questions about choosing between kingdoms with equal knights/rooks and selecting a surviving victor are not addressed in the provided material."

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

In this latter case, all bullet points serve as a reminder of what actions can be useful to accomplish the specified objective\". So for Main Objectives 1 to 5 and Secondary Objectives 1-4, the bullet lists are not ordered by priority. Paragraphs O3.b to O3.d give some guidance on which action to perform, but it's not precise/exhaustive. For the other objective cells, bullet lists are sorted by priority as you said. 4. Don’t know if it is correct but I can tell you that in that situation that is exactly what I do. 5. Yes, correct; this trigger’s occurrence is very low, in my experience as well. 6.

The priority order of actions is not strictly based on bullet points, as the rules mention that bullet points serve as reminders and are not necessarily ordered by priority. 4.

The sides of the tableau do not define the location of the cards, as stated in the reference material: 'A bishop placed on a card inactivates all its Tableau Operations, except the Religious operations (in a blue ellipse), Prestige icons and card abilities.'

The choice of color does not imply that Schwarzer Haufen heavy cavalry were Islamic. This aligns with option b, as the reference material does not mention any thematic or historical link between the color of the agents and the historical background, suggesting that the color choice is not meant to represent Islamic influence or multiculturalism."

The reference material does not explicitly mention the solo AI rules for Pax Renaissance, but it does provide information on how bishops are used in the game. The example given in option a, 'if Buddhism has more bishops than all others combined,' aligns with the game's mechanics where bishops play a role in determining religious influence. The explanation of 'dominant religion' being defined for each row of Table O5 in the trigger column and not being the same as 'supreme religion' is consistent with the game's complexity and the need for specific definitions in different contexts. The other options mention different tables and religions that are not supported by the reference material provided."

The rules do not explicitly mention the placement of a 'concession' in the context of a campaign. However, the term 'concession' is used in the context of the Globalization victory condition, which involves having more pawns on the board. Since the question asks about the placement of a concession after a campaign, and the rules do not specify this, the most logical assumption is that the concession (pawns) would be placed adjacent to the empire that launched the campaign, as this aligns with the concept of expanding influence from the attacking empire. Therefore, option c) 'The concession goes adjacent to the empire that launched the campaign' is the most appropriate choice."

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

However, the description of one-shot operations suggests that the placement of knights/rooks/pawns occurs first, followed by the resolution of the one-shot operation. Since the Apostasy operation involves discarding cards with Religion Prestige icons, it implies that the operation is resolved as a whole action. Therefore, placing a bishop on a card to inactivate it would not occur before the resolution of the one-shot operation. Thus, option (a) is correct: 'No, you may not place the Bishop on your opponent's Epicurean Swerve before resolving the Apostasy One Shot.

According to the rules, a Peasant Revolt involves attackers and defenders, where attackers are the knights/rooks/pawns placed on the kingdom’s name, plus pirates and repressed pawns. The defenders are the number of rooks and knights inside the kingdom. In this scenario, activating the One-shot first results in a 1:1 battle between the agent and the knight, leading to 1:1 casualties. Since there are no surviving attackers, the Peasant Revolt is not successful. The rules state: 'Remove an equal number of attackers and defenders of your choice from the board.

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

This matters in this example if I were to place on an opponent's Papal States card that already has a bishop. Then for Diet of Worms, if I place both bishops there as one action, do both bishops I place die with the already existing action? Or is each bishop placement its own separate event so I can place one bishop first on the opponent's Papal States, the existing bishop and new bishop die, then I place the second one and it can survive?

The abilities do not alter the rule that you can only perform one east op and one west op per turn.

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

This is consistent with the rules that bishops silence cards they are placed on. 3. Yes, republics are part of your tableau and can be silenced by bishops, but bishops are not discarded as part of strawman regime changes. The reference material does not specify that bishops are discarded when a monarch is flipped, only that they are discarded if the empire square comes from an enemy tableau or is flipped in your own tableau (see STRAWMAN)."

        "question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

It confirms that the AI's behavior aligns with the player's observations, particularly in points 1 and 2, where the AI tends to focus on row 6 of table O8 and only activates One-shots if they are beneficial. It also clarifies the priority order of actions in table O8, explaining that for Main Objectives 1 to 5 and Secondary Objectives 1-4, the bullet lists are not ordered by priority, which directly addresses question 3. Additionally, it acknowledges the low occurrence of certain triggers, which answers questions 5 and 6.

According to the reference material, 'An Ability that lets you run an Op for free still limits you to one “activate Ops” per East or West.' This means that even if you have an ability that allows you to perform both east and west ops as a single action, you cannot perform them both for free because each side can only be activated once per turn. Therefore, the ability to perform east ops without expending an action does not allow you to perform both east and west ops for free when combined with the ability to perform both as a single action."

        "prediction_explanation": "The correct answer is (a) Yes, if your opponent has a card in their tableau that states declaring a Globalization victory costs two actions, it affects all players' victory declarations. This is because the reference material indicates that certain card abilities affect the victory conditions for everyone, not just the player who owns the card. For example, the discussion about the Epicurean Swerve card mentions that it should say 'a Renaissance victory' instead of 'your Renaissance victory,' indicating that such abilities are intended to affect all players. Similarly, the Circassian Mamluks card's ability was clarified to affect religious supremacy for everyone, not just the card owner. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a card affecting the cost of declaring a Globalization victory would apply to all players."
