        "prediction_explanation": "The card ability 'Your concessions cannot be killed by pirates' suggests that while your concessions are immune to being removed by pirates, it does not prevent pirates from being placed on the same border. Therefore, the pirate can coexist with your concession. However, the ability implies that your concession is protected from the pirate's usual effect of 'killing' it, meaning the pirate does not interfere with the concession's function. In a trade fair, the pirate would still block the trade fair in that border, but your concession remains unaffected by the pirate's presence. Thus, option 'a' is the most accurate interpretation of the interaction."

The adjacent concession does not participate in a conspiracy one-shot, so the battle is 4 vs 1, not 5 vs 1. The attacker to be killed does not necessarily need to be one of the card agents; any of the 4 attackers are valid choices to be killed. Any surviving attackers that cannot be placed become repressed tokens on the empire card. This is supported by the rules: 'If there are more Victorious survivors after a Battle than Cities or Borders to house them, repress them for no cost.'"

This matters in this example if I were to place on an opponent's Papal States card that already has a bishop. Then for Diet of Worms, if I place both bishops there as one action, do both bishops I place die with the already existing action? Or is each bishop placement its own separate event so I can place one bishop first on the opponent's Papal States, the existing bishop and new bishop die, then I place the second one and it can survive?

However, it mentions that when a card is sold, it is discarded, which implies that it is placed in a discard pile. The most reasonable assumption is that the discard pile is public, as is common in many board games, allowing players to see which cards have been discarded. Therefore, option a) 'Cards sold from hand are placed in a public discard pile, visible to all players.' is the most likely correct answer."

Are you allowed to split where the bishops go (e.g., one on Papal States throne, one on the card itself)? Is the placement of both pieces considered one event or is it considered two, one after the other? This matters in this example if I were to place on an opponent's Papal States card that already has a bishop. Then for Diet of Worms, if I place both bishops there as one action, do both bishops I place die with the already existing action? Or is each bishop placement its own separate event so I can place one bishop first on the opponent's Papal States, the existing bishop and new bishop die, then I place the second one and it can survive? On a more general note for the 1st question, other cards that allow placement of 2 or more pieces like a rook and a knight, can I split them and are they separate placements too?",
