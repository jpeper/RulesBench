This matters in this example if I were to place on an opponent's Papal States card that already has a bishop. Then for Diet of Worms, if I place both bishops there as one action, do both bishops I place die with the already existing action? Or is each bishop placement its own separate event so I can place one bishop first on the opponent's Papal States, the existing bishop and new bishop die, then I place the second one and it can survive? On a more general note for the 1st question, other cards that allow placement of 2 or more pieces like a rook and a knight, can I split them and are they separate placements too?", "correct_answer": "Each piece placement is separate, i.e., they happen one at a time. This is similar to other cards with 2 non-Bishop agents where you can place the first agent, then repress it with the second agent. In your case, you can place the first bishop, then place the second bishop after resolving the first placement.", "distractors": {"from_scratch": ["The placement of both bishops is considered a single event, so they must be placed simultaneously without resolving individual effects in between.", "You cannot split the placement of bishops; both must be placed on the same location, either the card or the Papal States throne.", "The placement of bishops is resolved as one collective action, meaning all effects, such as Diet of Worms, apply to both bishops at the same time.", "You can only place bishops on the Papal States throne, and the Oratory of Divine Love card does not allow splitting or separate placements.", "Both bishops must be placed on the same card, and any effects triggered by the placement will apply to both bishops together as a single event."], "from_rulebook": ["Both bishops must be placed simultaneously and cannot be resolved one at a time.", "You can only place bishops on the card itself, not on Thrones or other locations.", "Placing bishops on an opponent's card is not allowed under any circumstances.", "If a bishop dies during placement, the second bishop cannot be placed.", "Cards that allow placement of two pieces require both pieces to be placed on the same location."], "from_forum": ["Both bishops must be placed simultaneously on the same location, as the card effect is a single event.", "The placement of two bishops is considered a single action, so both must be placed before resolving any effects.", "You can only place one bishop with the card, and the second bishop must be placed on a subsequent turn.", "The two bishops must always be placed on different locations, regardless of the situation.", "Both bishops are placed as a single event, and any effects triggered apply to both simultaneously."]}, "url": "https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3384950"}
{"multiple_choice_question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance.

{"multiple_choice_question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance. In a scenario where Byzantium has one defending knight in Caffa, and there is one repressed rook and one repressed knight on the empire square, with a concession on the border, if a conspiracy is played with two agent knights resulting in a 5 vs 1 battle, and the knight in Caffa dies along with one agent, what happens to the other repressed piece or the extra agents that can't be placed?
