I asked Phil Eklund about this issue (twice) and both times he indicated that if a player did not have the florins required to repress an agent and he was required to do so (i.e., after a one-shot), then he could not implement the one-shot.  He indicated that  he would make this clear in the Living Rules, but obviously he has not yet done so.<br/><br/>Please feel free to play the game the way you think it should be played.  All I have done is to convey the designer's intent as he has explained it to me, which I actually prefer since it results in one less rules exception that I have to remember.\n<font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Kevin Lee Thatcher wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><br/>Please feel free to play the game the way you think it should be played.

How is it possible to say that you disagree with the conclusion of the above quotes? What other possible ways can you interpret them? Especially this sentance, what do you think it means? <br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i> (3) Place surviving Agents into the empty Cities, repressing for free once the Empire is Saturated. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Sorry to nag on this issue, but I think it's important to follow the rules, and I've read them pretty carefully.<br/><br/>I have now quoted several passages in the rules book which explicitly states that this is the way it is to be played. May I please see this communication with Phil Eklund that you refer to? Because right now I only have the word of a random BGG user for it. If you can show me any written source that makes this claim credible it would help. I'm not usually one to ask for \"official confirmation\", but in case where someone claims that the actual rules contradict the rules as written I'm willing to make an exception.<br/><br/>To me it sounds like he may have answered another question than this. I get that in other cases where a card tells you to place agents, this will cause you to have to pay to repress if there isn't room for them on the map or borders. However, with victorious survivors of a one-shot war the rules are different. It would seem extremely weird that the rules are actually the opposite of what is noted several times in the updated living rules, where this is explicitly stated as an exception to the general rule - twice. The \"Play cards & place agents\" paragraph even reminds to pay to repress under the \"If no One-Shot\" paragraph, while it refers to the agents as \"Victorious\" in case of successful one shot war. Which is again refered to in the line <b>\"If there are more Victorious survivors after a Battle than Cities or Borders to house them, repress them for no cost.\"</b>. Again - how do you interpret that? <br/>\nOK, I think you are right and we might be addressing different issues.  Here is the specific question that I posed to Phil Eklund (if anyone is interested this discussion is in Ion's Pax Renaissance Discord thread):<br/><br/>I decide to play Conquistadors and decide to implement the One-Shot Trade Shift.  That means I MUST place the 2 Knights onto the map.  That much is clear from the rules. <br/> What if Portugal is saturated?  Does that mean that I must now repress 2 Agents and place the new ones on the map?  <b>Answer:  YES </b> And what if I do not have 2 Florins to repress the Agents? Does that mean I cannot implement the One-Shot?  <b>Answer: YES</b><br/><br/>And with that, I have said everything that I am going to say on the topic.  Hopefully it will help someone down the road if they run into a similar situation.\n<font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Kevin Lee Thatcher wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><font color=#0B5C0D><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Gaeruil wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><font color=#6F0C0C><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>HaggbartSlark wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><font color=#6F4C0C><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Gaeruil wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>HaggbartSlark wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>You don't pay to repress it the repression is the result from a war.<br/><br/>From the rules book<br/><br/><font color=#0B5C0D><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>If there are more Victorious survivors after a Battle than Cities or Borders to house them, repress them for no cost. </i></div></div></font></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>E2.b.

May I please see this communication with Phil Eklund that you refer to? Because right now I only have the word of a random BGG user for it. If you can show me any written source that makes this claim credible it would help. I'm not usually one to ask for \"official confirmation\", but in case where someone claims that the actual rules contradict the rules as written I'm willing to make an exception.<br/><br/>To me it sounds like he may have answered another question than this. I get that in other cases where a card tells you to place agents, this will cause you to have to pay to repress if there isn't room for them on the map or borders. However, with victorious survivors of a one-shot war the rules are different. It would seem extremely weird that the rules are actually the opposite of what is noted several times in the updated living rules, where this is explicitly stated as an exception to the general rule - twice. The \"Play cards & place agents\" paragraph even reminds to pay to repress under the \"If no One-Shot\" paragraph, while it refers to the agents as \"Victorious\" in case of successful one shot war. Which is again refered to in the line <b>\"If there are more Victorious survivors after a Battle than Cities or Borders to house them, repress them for no cost.\"</b>. Again - how do you interpret that? <br/>"

The adjacent concession would not participate in a Conspiracy one-shot.<br/><br/>The attacker to be killed does not necessarily need to be one of the card agents - any of the 4 attackers are valid choices for you to choose to be killed. Any surviving attackers that cannot be placed become repressed tokens on the empire card. I think this is best summarized in the glossary entry for BATTLE, step \u201ci\u201d for Placement."
