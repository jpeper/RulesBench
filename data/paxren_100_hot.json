The campaign used mamluks but was Not a Mamluk campaign to expand the Mamluk empire.

For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?",

I have found that the narratives from the solo game are very interesting.  Furthermore, it isn't very easy to beat the solo bot.

                "content": "OK.  This whole issue has started to obsess me, so I did a little research to see how prevalent the OP's situation might be.<br/><br/>According to the card database here in the BGG files, there are a total of 48 No-Battle One-Shots:  17 Coronations, 16 Trade Shifts and 15 Apostasies.  None of the Coronations places any Agents, so the question is irrelevant for them.  12 of the Apostasies place only Pirates or Bishops, both of which are placed for free and neither of which suppresses any other Agent.  So they are out.  6 of the Trade Shifts place only Pirates or 1 x Rook, neither of which will cause an issue (Pirates for the reason noted above and Rooks because of the point Daniel made in an earlier post).<br/><br/>So this leaves 13 potentially problematic cards (3 Apostasies and 10 Trade Shifts)<br/><br/>The apostasies are Santa Hermandad (1 x Knight: The West), Marechaussee (1 x Rook: The West) and Swabian League (2 x Knight: HRE).  The first two are only an issue if every single one of the 6 western locations is saturated.  Possible, but not likely.  On the other hand, I can see Swabian League potentially requiring a player to suppress Agents in HRE.<br/><br/>As for the 10 Trade Shift cards, 9 of them require the placement of a Pawn.  The other one (Conquistadors) requires the placement of 2 x Knights, which like Swabian League can potentially be problematic.<br/><br/>So in summary, I think players will likely not face the OP's situation in any given game, but there is definitely a chance of it occurring.<br/><br/>As for the answer to the OP's question, based on the wording of the Pax Renaissance rules dated March 11, 2021 I would stick to my earlier response.  Based on the wording, agents must be deployed and if they can't be, then the player cannot implement the One-Shot (this assumes, of course, that the March 11 rules are the latest iteration of the Living Rules).<br/><br/>Probably an issue that someone should bring up with Phil and the gang at Ion Games.<br/><br/>"

Complicating the chronology is the fact that Phil's comment about having rewritten E2.1b for clarity is dated December 13, 2020, which suggests that his rewrite ought to be visible in your PDF, but since <i>both</i> of the documents linked above differ from the printed rulebook in how they word E2.1b, my best guess is that Phil rewrote it in December 2020, that this rewrite was captured in March 2021 to create the PDF you're referring to, and that E2.1b was revised again sometime subsequently, but without an accompanying note in the living rules.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the living rules I quoted are the most recent document, as Phil is still actively replying to suggestions in there and making changes when appropriate. But I don't know how to square the response that you got from him with the inclusion of the phrase \"if there is space for it\" in the latest version of E2.1b. I think I'll leave a suggestion directly in the rules document asking for a clarification on this point."

The same issue applies to them.  Joe Farrell has gone to the Living Rules and asked Phil to confirm what he told me yesterday.  The latest Living Rules do seem to indicate the same thing as the Russian rules.  That being said, in my opinion it is a fiddly exception to the overarching rule that agents MUST be placed if the one-shot occurs.  It also adds another interesting dilemma; if you have a saturated map card (either Knights, Rooks or Pawns), shouldn't the implementation of a one-shot event \"shake things up\" on that map card, causing some disgruntled (i.e., repressed) agents?  That is how I view things."

The Refresh Market Phase rule (D2) begins with \"If there are gaps in the Market ...\", which suggests that any such gaps mean that the Market needs refreshing.

        "formatted_answer": "No, the abilities of Card A and Card B cannot be combined in such a way. You cannot use the 'east & west ops in one action' ability after using the 'activate eastern ops without expending an action' ability because you cannot run east ops twice in one turn. The special abilities do not supersede the restriction that you can only run west ops once per turn and east ops once per turn. Therefore, once you have used the 'east ops without expending an action' ability, the 'east & west ops in one action' ability is effectively the same as just running west ops normally.",

Abilities are always active as long as they're in play and not silenced; whether they appear on the west or east side of your tableau is irrelevant. You don't need to run ops in order to activate the card abilities in that side of your tableau. Running ops just lets you activate up to one op on each card on one side of your tableau. Abilities are not ops.<br/><br/>The reason the \"west and east ops in one action\" ability is no longer useful once you've run the \"east ops without spending an action\" ability is that, per D1, you cannot run east ops twice in one turn. So the effect of the \"west and east ops in one action\" ability is exactly the same as just running west ops normally.<br/><br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>schone wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>And finally, just to make sure i understand the actions that are allowed only once per turn.

Shorter short answer is like Kevin responded, in all 3 Vassal examples you've shown the Queen and bishop are retained as the Vassal returning to its throne is not due to it experiencing a regime change.<br/><br/>Very astute questions. I think the confusion arises from the way these rules are split up and/or repeated across multiple glossary entries. <br/><br/>My short answers to your questions are:<br/><strike>1) No, Queens and Bishops are not retained in case #3  (i.e. Regime Changes), regardless of Suzerain/Vassal status</strike><br/>1) Yes, the Queen and Bishop of the Vassal are retained in case #3 since the Vassal did not experience the Regime Change itself and was moved as the result of the Suzerain's Regime Change (see answer to #3 below).<br/>2) Repressed Tokens are never discarded as a result of moving an Empires Square<br/>3) A Vassal returning to its throne is not considered a Regime Change<br/><br/>More detail behind the rationale for each of the short answers above:<br/>Another edit:<br/>1) Empire Squares undergoing a Regime Change are never returned to their throne as the result of a Regime Change. Regime Changes do not result in the discard of empire squares, rather they move empire squares <i>from</i> their throne or another Tableau <i>to</i> your Tableau, or flip an empire square in your Tableau).  In the case of Vassals whose Suzerain undergoes a Regime Change, the Vassal returns to its throne, but does not experience a Regime Change itself and so the Queen and bishop are retained. <br/><br/>Subsequently, the language about Regime Change in <b>DISCARD a).</b> isn't applicable (and should be removed). What seems to have happened here is a copying of language from other sections (e.g. the glossary entry for QUEEN) that detail the two instances when Queens are discarded. The way I teach it is that Bishops and Queens 1) follow Empire Squares to and from the throne, except for Queens in the case of beheading, and 2) are discarded in Regime Changes.<br/><br/>2) Per the glossary entry for REPRESSED TOKEN, \"If an Empire Square with Repressed Tokens moves, the Repressed Tokens remain on the tile.\" You have correctly identified the instances when these tokens may be affected though (Civil Wars, emancipation, pacification).<br/><br/>3) Again, returning a Vassal (or any empire square) to its throne is not a Regime Change. While in the case of Vassals this may have been initiated by the Regime Change of a Suzerain, the Vassal itself has not undergone a Regime Change.<br/><br/>If I've misunderstood some of your questions or my responses don't make sense, let me know, happy to discuss more.<br/>  \nIn all three cases queens and bishops are retained. \ud83d\ude42  Enjoy!\nThank you Van and Peter, <br/>I was away from home and didn\u2019t follow the discussion.<br/>The different ways Empires move to/from thrones and different tableaux, and the different locations in the rules addressing those moves form a kind of a maze (not to say a mess...)",

Empires</b> says: \" <u>Retain any Repressed Tokens and Bishops but Discard the Queen (if any) if </u>beheaded or <u>REGIME CHANGE</u><br/><br/>From the \"Regime Change\" definition, (and except when coming from its Throne), Bishops and Queens are discarded when an Empire is affected by a Regime Change. <br/><br/>A Vassal returns to its Throne in three cases:<br/>1) The Vassal is sold<br/>2) Its Suzerain is sold (better sell the Vassal before\u2026)<br/>3) Its Suzerain is subject to a Regime Change<br/><br/>As I read it, in cases 1) and 2) the Queen and Bishop are retained, but case 3) is not clear...<br/><br/><b>Repressed tokens:</b><br/>They always follow their Empire during Regime changes, right?<br/>They are never discarded, but may be killed during Civil Wars or Pacification, or emancipated during a Regime change.<br/>When a Vassal returns to its Throne, is it considered a Regime change, and can they benefit from Emancipation?<br/><br/>(I ask this because in the last living rules from the first version they were discarded)<br/><br/></i></div></div></font><br/>Edited to clarify the conflicting language I presented in the short answer and longer answers. Shorter short answer is like Kevin responded, in all 3 Vassal examples you've shown the Queen and bishop are retained as the Vassal returning to its throne is not due to it experiencing a regime change.<br/><br/>Very astute questions. I think the confusion arises from the way these rules are split up and/or repeated across multiple glossary entries. <br/><br/>My short answers to your questions are:<br/><strike>1) No, Queens and Bishops are not retained in case #3  (i.e. Regime Changes), regardless of Suzerain/Vassal status</strike><br/>1) Yes, the Queen and Bishop of the Vassal are retained in case #3 since the Vassal did not experience the Regime Change itself and was moved as the result of the Suzerain's Regime Change (see answer to #3 below).<br/>2) Repressed Tokens are never discarded as a result of moving an Empires Square<br/>3) A Vassal returning to its throne is not considered a Regime Change<br/><br/>More detail behind the rationale for each of the short answers above:<br/>Another edit:<br/>1) Empire Squares undergoing a Regime Change are never returned to their throne as the result of a Regime Change. Regime Changes do not result in the discard of empire squares, rather they move empire squares <i>from</i> their throne or another Tableau <i>to</i> your Tableau, or flip an empire square in your Tableau).  In the case of Vassals whose Suzerain undergoes a Regime Change, the Vassal returns to its throne, but does not experience a Regime Change itself and so the Queen and bishop are retained. <br/><br/>Subsequently, the language about Regime Change in <b>DISCARD a).</b> isn't applicable (and should be removed). What seems to have happened here is a copying of language from other sections (e.g. the glossary entry for QUEEN) that detail the two instances when Queens are discarded. The way I teach it is that Bishops and Queens 1) follow Empire Squares to and from the throne, except for Queens in the case of beheading, and 2) are discarded in Regime Changes.<br/><br/>2) Per the glossary entry for REPRESSED TOKEN, \"If an Empire Square with Repressed Tokens moves, the Repressed Tokens remain on the tile.\" You have correctly identified the instances when these tokens may be affected though (Civil Wars, emancipation, pacification).<br/><br/>3) Again, returning a Vassal (or any empire square) to its throne is not a Regime Change. While in the case of Vassals this may have been initiated by the Regime Change of a Suzerain, the Vassal itself has not undergone a Regime Change.<br/><br/>If I've misunderstood some of your questions or my responses don't make sense, let me know, happy to discuss more.<br/>  "

There is slight room for doubt in the rules, but it seems to me fairly clear that just like for any other regime change, emancipation is optional, and moreover you can definitely only do it if there are empty Cities (for knights or rooks) or Borders (for pawns) in the location (the Vote example on p.23 of the rules shows a scenario in which none of the serfs are emancipated following the Vote because the Borders are full).<br/><br/>The room for doubt arises because in the Glossary under Repressed Token it says \u201cEach [Repressed Token] increases the cost of a vote in an Empire by 1 Florin, and are Emancipated by the vote.  Each can fight in certain Battles and may be Emancipated.\u201d This gives the impression that Emancipation following a Vote might be more automatic than Emancipation following other actions.  However, the section in the main rules on Vote makes no specific mention of Emancipation and simply says \u201cDemocratic Events.  See REGIME CHANGE.\u201d  The Glossary entry for REGIME CHANGE then describes Emancipation but makes no distinction between Emancipation following a vote and other Emancipations, saying simply that \u201cIf you cause a Regime Change \u2026 you may move any or all of the Repressed Tokens from the Empire Square onto its Map Location (into either empty Cities for Rooks or Knights, or into its empty Borders for Concessions).\u201d<br/><br/>In view of this we have always played that all Emancipations are optional \u2013 but I\u2019m willing to be corrected if someone gives an official view to the contrary.<br/>",

There is slight room for doubt in the rules, but it seems to me fairly clear that just like for any other regime change, emancipation is optional, and moreover you can definitely only do it if there are empty Cities (for knights or rooks) or Borders (for pawns) in the location (the Vote example on p.23 of the rules shows a scenario in which none of the serfs are emancipated following the Vote because the Borders are full).<br/><br/>The room for doubt arises because in the Glossary under Repressed Token it says \u201cEach [Repressed Token] increases the cost of a vote in an Empire by 1 Florin, and are Emancipated by the vote.  Each can fight in certain Battles and may be Emancipated.\u201d This gives the impression that Emancipation following a Vote might be more automatic than Emancipation following other actions.  However, the section in the main rules on Vote makes no specific mention of Emancipation and simply says \u201cDemocratic Events.  See REGIME CHANGE.\u201d  The Glossary entry for REGIME CHANGE then describes Emancipation but makes no distinction between Emancipation following a vote and other Emancipations, saying simply that \u201cIf you cause a Regime Change \u2026 you may move any or all of the Repressed Tokens from the Empire Square onto its Map Location (into either empty Cities for Rooks or Knights, or into its empty Borders for Concessions).\u201d<br/><br/>In view of this we have always played that all Emancipations are optional \u2013 but I\u2019m willing to be corrected if someone gives an official view to the contrary.<br/>"

Makes the difficulty in achieving that type of win suitably challenging IMO.<br/><br/>Also, the only card that puts out 2 bishops (Oratory of Divine Love) is a Papal States card - so the targeted bishops should have been put well enough away from Papal States and/or the West (NEVER leave a bishop that you want to protect on a West or East card).

Empire Squares as considered to be Cards <b>only</b> when they are in your tableau. So your quotes of the glossary actually give you a very straight answer. Moving or discarding a <b>Card </b> (including Empires in your own tableau) will have the Bishop follow. The Bishop will be discarded if coming from another Tableau or if you flip an Empire in your own.<br/><br/>So, in the case of a Coronation in your own Tableau - Regime Change that does NOT flip your Empire Square - the Bishop remains (immediately silencing the Royal Couple).<br/><br/>Note that in addition to that, if you check Glossary entry BISHOP, you are reminded that Bishops not only do not Battle, but cannot be Repressed either. Which means that moving back an Empire to its throne (by any means) will also discard the Bishop."

But when the older kids visit it\u2019s knives out and we bring out Game of Thrones, War of Whispers, Battle of Rokugan , Dune , etc. <br/>It brings me joy to realize 4 children will bond, stop tormenting each other, and rally against against a common foe (Dad).<br/><br/>But even so, my regular wargaming buddies will look for any/all opportunities to take down the current leader of a given game and try to set themselves up, or someone else for the win. I myself once offered someone a slice of pizza if they voted for me as Roman Consul, and then proceeded to win a tournament game of Republic of Rome.<br/>Multiplayer competitive games are all different and some can suffer from \u201cKingmaker\u201d issues. Pax Pamir at 5 players often resulted in a situation where if player #1 is going to win on their next turn, the table now has a dilemma. If 2-4 can\u2019t change the game state, player 5 can decide who wins.<br/><br/>My point is that many other great multiplayer games defined the rules and/or limits to those interactions, this one did not.<br/>Either way, I\u2019m loving this game."

We had trouble with the 'Victor placement' column of the Table.\n<br/>\n<br/>What does 'Victor Placement' even mean in this regard? Are these the pieces you're supposed to play after the conclusion of the battle?\n<br/>\n<br/>For all battle types (campaign, religious, etc.) it says in the 'Victor placement' column: 'Bonus Concession'. I couldn't find a reference to the placement of bonus concessions after a battle in the rules, so we struggled with what this meant a lot.\n<br/>Is it possible this refers to the concession gained from the 'Regime Change'? Or do you get an extra concession in addition to the concession from the Regime Change?\n<br/>\n<br/>Thanks in advance for clarifying these noob questions <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/tongue.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" />\n<br/>Even though it was a difficult puzzle at times yesterday, I can't wait to play again!"

Yes a bishop can be placed on an unclaimed empire square in its throne. Regarding their movement from thrones, remember 2 things: a) per F1c you may not move a bishop on a throne directly to another throne (i.e. they don't move adjacently between thrones like they would tableau cards) and b) per F1, bishops can move to another card that has the same location as the one it currently sits on (in any tableau or throne). This means that a Bishop on a throne could be moved to any tableau card with that empire square's same location using the inquisitor action.<br/><br/>2. Correct, if there is no opponent tableau where your bishop can be placed, you must place the bishop in your own tableau (often the card that causes the bishop placement). However, remember from your question #1 that you can also place bishops on empire squares in their thrones. Assuming you don't have the empire square matching the bishop's location in your tableau, that is another option. Whether you want to place them in your own tableau, the throne, or an opponent's tableau will depend greatly on the board state. Sometimes you really need to protect those bishops for a religious victory (or preventing an opponent's) and the best way is keeping them in your tableau.<br/><br/>3. Yes, republics are part of your tableau and can be silenced by bishops just like kings. Bishops are discarded as part of strawman regime changes (see the glossary entry for Regime Change, section d, \"If the Empire Square comes from its THRONE, it comes with its Bishop (if any) and Queen (if any). If the Empire Square comes from an enemy Tableau, or if it is flipped in your own Tableau (see STRAWMAN), Bishops and Queens are Discarded and any Vassals returned to their Thrones.\" So in your example, the bishop would be discarded.",

Alternatively, you may place it on any Tableau card (even in an opponent\u2019s Tableau) or Throne that has the same Location as the Tableau card being played.</i><br/><br/>So 3 things to clarify in my head..<br/><br/>1. I know they can be placed/moved onto empire squares in a players tableau with inquisition.. but since \u201cthrones\u201d means the area on the map where empire squares start at setup, does this mean the bishop can be placed on the unclaimed empire square directly in the map area? If so, how do you move them with inquisition? Or, are they stuck there until the square is obtained?<br/><br/>2. If there\u2019s no opponent tableau a bishop can legally be placed, you have to put the agent on your own card. Do you just end up silencing your own cards until you can get rid of it? <br/><br/>3. Can the bishop affect Republics or move onto them? What if the monarch gets flipped, does the bishop get removed?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!</i></div></div></font><br/>Great questions, answers from my understanding of the <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f9lgr6zcptm2pz4/AAADCP-sZLxpC0USjaQZ2Sbla?dl=0&preview=PRen2+Rules+BOOK+I.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">current rules</a> are as follows (please correct me folks if I'm wrong!):<br/><br/>1. Yes a bishop can be placed on an unclaimed empire square in its throne. Regarding their movement from thrones, remember 2 things: a) per F1c you may not move a bishop on a throne directly to another throne (i.e. they don't move adjacently between thrones like they would tableau cards) and b) per F1, bishops can move to another card that has the same location as the one it currently sits on (in any tableau or throne). This means that a Bishop on a throne could be moved to any tableau card with that empire square's same location using the inquisitor action.<br/><br/>2. Correct, if there is no opponent tableau where your bishop can be placed, you must place the bishop in your own tableau (often the card that causes the bishop placement). However, remember from your question #1 that you can also place bishops on empire squares in their thrones. Assuming you don't have the empire square matching the bishop's location in your tableau, that is another option. Whether you want to place them in your own tableau, the throne, or an opponent's tableau will depend greatly on the board state. Sometimes you really need to protect those bishops for a religious victory (or preventing an opponent's) and the best way is keeping them in your tableau.<br/><br/>3. Yes, republics are part of your tableau and can be silenced by bishops just like kings. Bishops are discarded as part of strawman regime changes (see the glossary entry for Regime Change, section d, \"If the Empire Square comes from its THRONE, it comes with its Bishop (if any) and Queen (if any). If the Empire Square comes from an enemy Tableau, or if it is flipped in your own Tableau (see STRAWMAN), Bishops and Queens are Discarded and any Vassals returned to their Thrones.\" So in your example, the bishop would be discarded."

Holy Conspiracy Rule that would  allow introducing Theocracy during some Conspiracy one-shots  was in some versions 2nd edition rulebook for some time but won't be introduced in final rules.<br/>3.  Holy war  One-shots  remain the only way of introducing a theocracy but are limited by random deck setup and (usually) only usable once when played. <br/>And there will be 11 (?) more apostasies one-shots that make playing with religious prestige more risky.<br/><br/>So will Holy Victory be significantly harder to achieve in 2nd edition than in was 1st edition ? <br/><br/>OTOH, While teaching and playing the first edition, it seemed somewhat strange, that campaign ops from theocracy never resulted in map change.<br/>"

Search the Market from left to right until you find a card with a matching Location (including The West or The East) that fulfills the criteria defined in O3c and O3d. For Bishops, search the opponent\u2019s Tableau first, left to right, then yours.\n<br/>\n<br/>First of all, I'm assuming this refers to the location where the objective cell will be executed.  That being assumed, the concept of a \"location that achieves this objective by harming the player and helping the opponent\" seems remarkably subjective, given the complexity and subtlety of this game.  Is there an example someone could give of this in action?  I have been watching videos of Pax Ren games to help with learning and the one thing I have seen be consistent is the sensation that actions are far from black and white in terms of their ramifications.  What may seem beneficial one turn is actually detrimental the next.

Search the Market from left to right until you find a card with a matching Location (including The West or The East) that fulfills the criteria defined in O3c and O3d. For Bishops, search the opponent\u2019s Tableau first, left to right, then yours.\n<br/>\n<br/>First of all, I'm assuming this refers to the location where the objective cell will be executed.  That being assumed, the concept of a \"location that achieves this objective by harming the player and helping the opponent\" seems remarkably subjective, given the complexity and subtlety of this game.  Is there an example someone could give of this in action?  I have been watching videos of Pax Ren games to help with learning and the one thing I have seen be consistent is the sensation that actions are far from black and white in terms of their ramifications.  What may seem beneficial one turn is actually detrimental the next.  How are we to determine this for the AI?"

I was just playing and encountered a situation where the AI triggered the anti-imperialism row, attempting to prevent me from claiming that victory.  It was unable to gain or remove a kingdom, so it moved to the next cell, which instructed it to attempt to weaken my kingdom.  The only option was for it to run its ops, using a siege to destroy a token in one of my kingdoms.  <br/><br/>With only one action left, the AI moved down to the final row and ran a trade fair, which simply replaced the token it had just removed with its siege.  Is this an intended interaction?  It essentially invalidated the objective of the first action.<br/><br/>Thanks!"

The opponent\u2019s rules seem to be geared toward preventing <i>anyone</i> from getting a religious win, unless it stumbles into such a situation in spite of itself.</i></div></div></font><br/>So here\u2019s a specific example:<br/><br/>The opponent has 3 cards in its East tableau - Qizilbash (061) and Sahkulu Shi\u2019ite Revolt (115X) next to each other as well as Unified Christendom (100X). The first two have  Moslem bishops on them, the last has a Reform bishop. Hungary and Mamluk are both Islamic theocracies, each with one Moslem rook. The only other theocracy is the Papal States, with one Catholic rook, making Islam the Supreme religion. No comets have been triggered.<br/><br/>If the opponent had enough coin (it has none) it <i>could</i> buy a comet and win a holy victory, but according to the table it wouldn\u2019t do so even if it could.<br/><br/>The first trigger is row 3. It can\u2019t buy a card (no money) but it can siege either Hungary or Mamluk to even out the number of dominant religion agents.<br/><br/>After doing so, the second action triggers row 4. Again, the opponent can\u2019t buy cards, but it can use inquisitor or sell a card (it can\u2019t use behead because the card would have to behead itself, which is not permitted). So I played that it would use the inquisitor op to have the two Moslem bishops annihilate each other (which doesn\u2019t make sense to me thematically but that\u2019s what the Diet of Worms rule F1.a says).<br/><br/>Does this make sense within the parameters of the opponent\u2019s AI?<br/><br/>Would it use behead to remove its own cards if the situation permitted? Since it always places bishops that seems to encourage self-sabotage.<br/>"

However, there is debate about the thematic appropriateness of this rule, as it could lead to unlikely theocracies. Some players suggest that the rule should be adjusted to make the creation of a theocracy more challenging and thematically consistent, such as requiring all attackers to be of the same religion to flip the map card into a theocracy of that religion.",

A newly made theocracy could weirdly hold only Heretic tokens??<br/>As it is written now, I feel like a Holy Conspiracy could be victorious by having all Believer tokens killed (Agents on the card) & only victorious Heretic tokens populating the new map card (pirates, repressed ruling class of any other color on the Empire card joining the conspiracy).</i></div></div></font><br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>it still feels odd to me to have, for example, say an islamic knight, fighting in a holy catholic conspiracy, & be rewarded as a ruling class in this brand new theocratic catholic regime through emancipation....</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>After some exchange of thoughts, here what Phil Eklund answered:<br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Can you suggest a rewrite?<br/><br/>The theocracy being the same color of the agents was added because of a complaint that unlikely theocracies were being created.<br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I feel like, there could be an open discussion in this forum, as very few people answered to that comment.

Repress a piece or victourious conspiracy with Black Agent(s) on a christian theocracy, or vice-versa... \ud83d\ude00<br/>IMHO, as per the rules state now, that new way of creating a theocratic state (Holy conspiracy) could happen with literally every conspiracy: it doesn't need anything else to trigger than the conspiracy's succes & the will of the player.....  It isn't bad per-se, but I like the way it works in 1st ed: the rarity of the emergence of theocratic state, & the specific need for religious war. <br/>As stated now in living rules, every conspiracy could be a religious war, with quite equal chance of succes than a \"real\" religious war. I kinda feel that it could change the balance of the game, tilting toward religious victory, with the appearance of theocratical states almost everywhere! <br/>Moreover i find really un-thematic that a piece that is more enclined to support a certain religion, could participate in the elevation of another religion (why would you need to point out its religious affection in 1 st place then?).... nice if it could be a rare oddity, but as written now, I can see it happen a lot in every game.<br/> I like the idea that conspiracy could create theocracy though.... what do you think of my proposition?"

Polish rulebook says that in order to do One-Shot, I have to place all agents first, otherwise One-Shot is cancelled. "

Yesterday I finally taught the game to 2 friends of mine and apparently I did a great job teaching it, cause one of them won both games (one Imperial, one Renaissance).<br/>They liked it so much that insisted in playing again! Hehe.<br/>We played with both decks mixed with all expansion cards and the promos of the Spanish edition mixed in. <br/>I'm using 2 rules of the second edition: submitted pieces are placed on Empire Cards, even if they are not under players' control yet, and the one allowing players to marry Queens with their previously acquired Kings (kingdoms  cards) if those are still on that player's display.<br/>I also would like to implement the change for the West Trading Route, to have a third city (Emporium) on Mamelucos, sadly that's impossible without the appropriate cards.<br/><br/>Thanks Cameron!
