{"multiple_choice_question": "This question is about a boardgame called Pax Renaissance Second Edition. 1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? 2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? 3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right? 4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? 5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? 6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same?", "correct_answer": "1. Yes, in my experience this seems to be the case. 2. This is probably also correct; I also remember this being so, from an answer to a related thread. 3. Not exactly, the complete quote is: \"An objective cell lists either, (1) a single or multiple bullet points which are performed (in order), if possible, or (2) an objective followed by multiple bullet points. In this latter case, all bullet points serve as a reminder of what actions can be useful to accomplish the specified objective\". So for Main Objectives 1 to 5 and Secondary Objectives 1-4, the bullet lists are not ordered by priority. Paragraphs O3.b to O3.d give some guidance on which action to perform, but it's not precise/exhaustive. For the other objective cells, bullet lists are sorted by priority as you said. 4. Don’t know if it is correct but I can tell you that in that situation that is exactly what I do. 5. Yes, correct; this trigger’s occurrence is very low, in my experience as well. 6.
