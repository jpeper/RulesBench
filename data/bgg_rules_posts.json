I had Inquisition Pope in my tableau and a Catholic Bishop on the Queen of his Royal Couple. The ability of Inquisition Pope limits me to beheading cards with either a Cath. or Ref. Bishop on them. I know in most cases, other than ops, you treat the couple as one, but in the case of beheading with Inquisition pope, can I behead the King even though the Bishop is technically sitting on the Queen?? The rules clearly allow for beheading the king in the couple individually, but I'm wondering how Inquisitions's ability specifically interacts with the royal couple. Thanks!!"

May I please see this communication with Phil Eklund that you refer to? Because right now I only have the word of a random BGG user for it. If you can show me any written source that makes this claim credible it would help. I'm not usually one to ask for \"official confirmation\", but in case where someone claims that the actual rules contradict the rules as written I'm willing to make an exception.<br/><br/>To me it sounds like he may have answered another question than this. I get that in other cases where a card tells you to place agents, this will cause you to have to pay to repress if there isn't room for them on the map or borders. However, with victorious survivors of a one-shot war the rules are different. It would seem extremely weird that the rules are actually the opposite of what is noted several times in the updated living rules, where this is explicitly stated as an exception to the general rule - twice. The \"Play cards & place agents\" paragraph even reminds to pay to repress under the \"If no One-Shot\" paragraph, while it refers to the agents as \"Victorious\" in case of successful one shot war. Which is again refered to in the line <b>\"If there are more Victorious survivors after a Battle than Cities or Borders to house them, repress them for no cost.\"</b>. Again - how do you interpret that? <br/>"

Here is the specific question that I posed to Phil Eklund (if anyone is interested this discussion is in Ion's Pax Renaissance Discord thread):<br/><br/>I decide to play Conquistadors and decide to implement the One-Shot Trade Shift.  That means I MUST place the 2 Knights onto the map.  That much is clear from the rules. <br/> What if Portugal is saturated?  Does that mean that I must now repress 2 Agents and place the new ones on the map?  <b>Answer:  YES </b> And what if I do not have 2 Florins to repress the Agents? Does that mean I cannot implement the One-Shot?  <b>Answer: YES</b><br/><br/>And with that, I have said everything that I am going to say on the topic.  Hopefully it will help someone down the road if they run into a similar situation.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>In this scenario what Phil replied isn't in conflict with the rules as written, and this is how we would also have played it (but I agree that it should be clarified in the rules, because the one-shot example of cards only addresses one-shot wars, not other one-shots where you can also place agents, like trade-shifts). <br/><br/>The exception ONLY applies to victorious units/agents after wars.

You specifically asked about placement of survivors after a one shor war, which has seperate rules from the ones you quoted. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Ok and what is the answer ?</i></div></div></font><br/>I raised this exact issue with Phil recently.  He confirmed that in the case where agents must be placed on the map (i.e., after implementing a one-shot event), then the player is required to pay for any necessary repression.  If he cannot do so, then he cannot implement the one-shot.  Which makes sense to me.<br/><br/>I think this situation will be a relatively rare occurrence, at least for Rooks and Knights since one-shots usually result in at least some of them being lost.  I think it is most likely to occur with concessions, and then only in the case where all of the possible concession locations are filled.</i></div></div></font><br/> perfect, thx. What with Gonfalonieri card? That isn't one shot, no war, I can place 2 knights and the card has 2 knight. On the map there is 1 knight: If I want to play the agents I have ti suppress the existing Knight or I can simply add th second?</i></div></div></font><br/>In the case of no one-shot, the placement of Agents is completely voluntary.  So with Gonfalonieri you can place no knights, one knight to fill the Papal States, or two knights to fill the Papal States AND repress the starting Knight.  Lots of options.....</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Another little question about Gonfalonieri: if I repress a knight do I have to pay?</i></div></div></font><br/>I do not have the Gonfalonieri card in front of me, but I don't see why you would not have to pay to repress.</i></div></div></font><br/>because it is not a one shot but optional, in the gonfalonieri you can put 2 knights, I can't memorize the general rule, that is, when to repress is free or not</i></div></div></font><br/>I do recall what you are saying but I cannot recall exactly what it is.  I am pretty sure that it is not this situation, however.  In this case, the two knights are optional to put on the board because, as you say, you did not execute the one shot.  If you decide to repress, however, you must pay to do it."

If the card you're using has a location of \"Ottoman\", then you can't use it to attack Hungary - it can only be used to incite a religious war in the Ottoman empire. <br/><br/>That being said, knights and rooks NEVER move from one empire to another - neither for religious wars nor campaigns. If this is a Jihad in Hungary, you would eliminate 2 of the attackers (from any adjacent empire or agents on the card - your choice) and the 2 defenders in Hungary. If the card you're playing for the Jihad has any agent icons on it, and you didn't eliminate them as attackers, they would be placed in the empty space(s) in Hungary."

Is the placement of both pieces considered one event or is it considered two, one after the other? This matters in this example if I were to place on an opponent's Papal States card that already has a bishop. Then for Diet of Worms, if I place both bishops there as one action, then do both bishops I place die with the already existing action? Or is each bishop placement it's own separate event so I can place one bishop first on the opponent's Papal States, the existing bishop and new bishop die, then I place the second one and it can survive?<br/><br/>On a more general note for the 1st question, other cards that allow placement of 2 or more pieces like a rook and a knight, can I split them and are they separate placements too?"

Treat agents as pieces that are taking part in the battle in addition to those that are currently on the map. <br/><br/>If battle is won first put all agents on their corresponding spots. If there is not enough space repress them for free. After this you can liberate any number of pieces if there is space for it - in this step you can't repress and pay for it. Finally you can put your free concession from regime change. You can pay 1 coin to repress and replace other pieces.<br/><br/>The same is in revolt - if you have no space for pawn/concessions that comes as agents from card after winning a battle repress them for free.<br/>If you want put agent without using oneshot then you can place them on occupied space repressing one piece. It will cost you 1 coins for each replacement. You don't need to place all agent from the card."

EMPIRE SQUARES<br/>The ten two-sided Empire Squares start in the Throne (B2d) next to their Location. While here, they<br/>remain uninfluenced by any player. Whenever you acquire an Empire Square, whether through a Oneshot<br/>(E2), vote (F6) or campaign (F9), place it into your Tableau (East or West) with its King side (gold<br/>frame) faceup. If it becomes a Republic,6 turn its pillar-frame side faceup. While in your Tableau, treat<br/>both Kings and Republics as tableau cards.<br/><br/>"

England was full, but HRE had open spots.<br/><br/>We expected that the selling player would have had his 2 repressed pawns in HRE pop out, but they did not. Then he confirmed turn and it was a wasted turn.<br/><br/>Does anyone know why the \"Ending Subsistence Farming\" did not trigger in the HRE when the selling player had repressed pawns there and open spaces for those concessions to go? The only thing I can think is that since it is an England card, it only applies to England, but that special rules says \"...in the West\".<br/><br/>Thoughts?"

When sold the pair goes to the throne, available to the next player to attack the empire.<br/><br/>Campaigning it back to your tableau for 1 florin is the most efficient way to get the pair back. You ideally have 1 knight available and the target empire is completely open.<br/><br/>As long as you put the pair back into your tableau, no one else can do the same move for themselves with those cards. They can, of course, get rid of the crown by taking the empire for themselves, which is due to the subtly different regime change procedures regarding taking an empire from the throne vs from another player.<br/><br/>It's a funny way to repeatedly get 5 cash without moving the market. In a stalled game, doing this once or twice can put you in a great position. Don't do it too much though because you will lose tempo due to that greed <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" />"

However, I still sometimes ask myself, isn't it a permanent ability, which changes the amount of florins you get by selling other cards? A similar ability is printed on \"Reichskrone\", \"Theft of the Holy Crow\" and \"Cem Anti-Hostage\" card from the East deck. It says:\n<br/>\"RANSOM: Sell this card for 4 instead of 2 Florins\". \n<br/>The main difference between them is the word \"this\" - is the lack of this term on Conquistadors a typo (I would say so) or is Aztec Gold ability different in any way (i.e. allows selling other cards for 4 florins each?).\n<br/>\n<br/>- Machiavellianism\n<br/>\"PRGAMATIC TREACHERY: If you sell a card additionally may perform its civil war, crusade or apostasy One-shot (including adding its Agents).\"\n<br/>Well, does this rule apply to cards sold from tableau, hand or both? Rulebook in E3.c says: \"A card with an Ability affecting its sale may only use this ability if sold from tableau\". Aforementioned ability is not printed on the card being sold. Does this make a difference? Can I sell a card from hand and trigger Machiavellianism ability? It seems clear, that I can sell a card from tableau and do so, possibly activating the one shot twice (once from play, second from Machiavellianism)."

I suppose Leo Africanus says \"in one action\", which maybe implies it HAS to be an action and can't be a free action?  Though thought would not be my natural read.  "

Yesterday I finally taught the game to 2 friends of mine and apparently I did a great job teaching it, cause one of them won both games (one Imperial, one Renaissance).<br/>They liked it so much that insisted in playing again! Hehe.<br/>We played with both decks mixed with all expansion cards and the promos of the Spanish edition mixed in. <br/>I'm using 2 rules of the second edition: submitted pieces are placed on Empire Cards, even if they are not under players' control yet, and the one allowing players to marry Queens with their previously acquired Kings (kingdoms  cards) if those are still on that player's display.<br/>I also would like to implement the change for the West Trading Route, to have a third city (Emporium) on Mamelucos, sadly that's impossible without the appropriate cards.<br/><br/>Thanks Cameron!

For example, you are allowed to buy and play Podesta, then immediately perform the free action. The presence of that ability was not present at the start of turn, similar to how a silenced free east/west action is not present at the start of turn. It seems to me that there is a conflicting logic to this.<br/><br/>I am weary of asking Phil for clarification because his rulings tend to break other parts of the game. This is because Phil does not actively play this game and is simply not familiar with the rules anymore. You can see recent discussion in the Ion discord for more on that.<br/><br/>In my opinion the cleanest option is to allow the ability to become active immediately."

                "content": "I'm a huge fan of the Pax series (I rate Pax Pamir 2nd Ed and Pax Porfiriana in my top 5 games for solo play) so was really excited this week to finally get a copy of Pax Ren 2nd Ed. I struggled initially with the solo mode, but it started to click for me when I realised that the AI opponent isn't trying to reach one of the 4 main victory conditions. It will claim one of those if it accidentally gets it, but its main aim is to stop you winning before the clock runs out (i.e. both draw piles are empty). In the meantime the solo game allows you to interact with the Pax Ren mechanisms as a solo player. I like how the difficulty can be easily scaled by adding or removing cards to the draw piles.<br/><br/>I do have a few questions that I was hoping someone with more experience of the solo mode might be able to help with!<br/><br/>1. For the first 70%-80% of each of my games, the solo AI has mainly been activating row 6 of table O8 - so buying and playing a card, and in the process both adding to its tableau ops and reducing the draw pile (so reducing the time left for me to win). It has only been a few turns from the end of each game that the earlier rows of table O8 kicked in and the AI tried to take actions to stop me meeting a victory condition. Is that how the solo game normally pans out? <br/><br/>2. When playing a card due to row 6, I think the rules say that the AI will only activate the One-shot if it gains the AI an empire or hurts you more. So I'm finding that the Conspiracy One-shots with only one agent rarely activate (there are usually enough defenders to stop that action capturing an empire), so the AI buying such a card is effectively only advancing the draw pile, and maybe adding to its ops. Is that right? <br/><br/>3. I'm not completely clear the priority order of which of the possible actions to take in the objective columns of table O8. I played it that the priority is the order of the bulletpoints in the table. Is that right?<br/><br/>4. In particular, if you get to row 7 with 2 actions still remaining (because no triggers in earlier rows are in effect and there is no card available with prestige to fulfil row 6), should the AI take 2 trade fairs or do one trade fair and then try to do one of the other 2 bullets? <br/><br/>5. I don't understand the \"...or the opponent has less than 3 florins\" disclaimer in row 7 of table O8. Does that trigger ever kick in? If the opponent has 2 actions and, say, 2 florins, won't they buy a card as per row 6 if one with prestige is affordable? <br/><br/>6. I've never yet bought and played a card as per the Prestige Objectives in the final column of table O8. There seem to be very few cards with red text on. So if the main and secondary objectives couldn't be achieved, then I've always moved down to a later row rather than triggering a Prestige Objective. Do others find the same? <br/><br/>Sorry for so many questions, and apologies if I've missed the answers in the rules or elsewhere on these forums! I'm happy house-ruling these but wondered if there were official answers?<br/><br/>Thanks! "

That's what I call 'breaking easily' for a solo AI. <br/><br/>Even after houseruling the many ambiguities of the AI, the gameplay felt flat compared to multi-players. As explained by OP, by design the AI will spend most of the game between lines 6 and 7 of table O8, and it will only \"wake up\" and use the other 80% of its \"brain\" (lines 1-5 of table O8) when a comet card appears. And then, while a potential victory is in sight, the AI will not even try to win, but only to frustrate the player. <br/><br/>For me, the PaxRen2 AI lacks both the fun, simplicity and unpredictability of PaxPamir2e 's AI, and the precision and purpose of a COIN AI. In my opinion this solo AI is simply not a good design, clearly inferior to the one of PaxPamir2e.<br/><br/>I still enjoy the game, but it's not one for true solo.<br/>"

So when I go through Portugal (I have a Rook in Toledo from the first turn) there is only a spot for a Green Rook.  Where would I place the supposed 2nd Kinght?<br/><br/>Thanks!</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Yes, I just had a look at the book, and as far as I can see that might be an error. You're right -- levy needs to place the piece pictured in the space.  <br/>  <br/>On the bright side, you're obviously getting enough of a grip on rules details that you're able to start pointing out errors, so learning is going well.  <br/>  <br/>And I second the suggestion to jump on BGA once you feel you've come to terms with everything. Pax Ren can be a lot of fun, playing multihanded against yourself, but nothing can quite compare to the feeling of competing against others."

If action is concentrated in the West at the beginning of the game, then yeah, you're likely to see trade fairs reaching over to that side of the board early. But if there are early regime changes available in the East, then you're going to have a lot of concessions positioned along the early parts of those trade routes and not many market florins building up in the West, and of course the East trade fair doesn't even reach the West unless someone plays a trade shift.<br/><br/>Most players will look for regime changes early, so concessions come onto the board quickly. So even when there is a lot of play in the West, while it might not be hard to get levies in the first few Western empires along the trade route, it can be very difficult to get them in England, France, or especially the HRE."

                "content": "The frequency with which players activate the trade fairs also impacts how far they can reach in some cases. If people are trade fair-ing often, then the pool of florins for each fair will likely tend to be fewer (since it's whatever has built up since the last fair), and the fair is more likely to conclude before it reaches the end of the route. This can be a legit strategy for players whose concessions lie earlier in the route to trigger the fair sometimes, even if their $$ gain alone maybe wouldn't feel like enough reason to take that action. The Florin economy can be very tight, so maintaining an influx of one or two for yourself, while keeping opponents from getting much/any can make a difference.  <br/>  <br/>If your play group determines that you're playing by the rules, and that trade routes just tend to play out in full a lot of the time, you (or anyone) can use that knowledge to mess with them by prioritizing pirate play, cards with either west/east tax ops, trade shifts, etc, more than maybe they have been prioritized so far. I think Pax Ren is a game with so many potential moves/situations that it's almost impossible to be thinking about everything at once. And if you get the sense that there are certain elements of the game that other players have begun to take for granted or which have become comfortable for them, then the fact that they're counting on those things (or are paying less attention to them maybe) is ammo for you. I realize that it really still comes down to what cards show up in the market, but any chance to shake your opponents out of their comfort zone is high on my priority list when I play."

A clarification would be good. <br/><br/>It makes a big difference as if it is before regime change, the Bish would be eliminated in the event the player chose to place the Bish on the 'conquered' empire as per glossary Regime Change (d). A player can do this as a way of eliminating the Bishop or place the Bish on another same location card. <br/><br/>I'm wondering if I've misunderstood the rule as it came up in a game played recently and there was some disagreement on interpretation amongst our group. For ease of game flow we let players do as they pleased on this but would like do it properly for the next game.   <br/><br/>Unless of course I've misunderstood the interaction of rules my take is that it's before regime change as that's my literal reading of the rules but I may have missed something.

If there is a peasant revolt with 2 Agents (2 Pawns) and I win the upcoming fight without losing any of those pawns but the concession places are all fully saturated and I cant pay the 1 Florin to repress a concession do the 2 Agents become repressed (on the kingdom card) or do they leave the game? (We used them as repressed pawns then)<br/><br/>3. Maybe its because we both played it first time yesterday, but we had the feeling that its not that easy to get new units on the board in the late game (the market was mostly dry on Florins due to commerce Ops beeing used a lot). I guess we should play tax more to defend some kingdoms but I'm not sure if we made a misstake somewhere. I lost due to a stream of campaign Ops in the lategame, because there were mostly 1 unit left on the kingdoms and he had the economic advantage to fund more campaigns than me."

On the map, it's a West empire, but I've just carried out a regime change there using an East card. My two clarifying questions are:  <br/>  <br/>1. Am I right that when I take the king for the regime change, I add it to my Eastern tableau? In other words, I choose the tableau to add the King to based on the location printed on the conspiracying card, NOT based on the HRE's printed location on the map?  <br/>   <br/>2. My opponent has a bishop and a matching colored Inquisitor action whose location is \"West\". If he takes one Inqu action to move the bishop to the HRE King card (which is a western empire), can he then use a future Inqu action to move the bishop from the King to the HRE location card I've played, even though that's technically an East card? I'm pretty sure this is legal, and an intentional, canny way to globetrot your bishop, but I just wanted to be sure.  <br/>  <br/>Thanks for your help!"

The HRE is a Western empire, so it goes to the West. The only way you can have an empire square in your tableau on the opposite side as its location is if a Western empire is a vassal of an Eastern suzerain or vice versa.<br/><br/>2. Inquisitor ops don't have locations. Per F1, an Inquisitor op can move <i>any</i> bishop of the appropriate religion, and the legal destinations for that piece depend on the location of the card on which the bishop currently resides, not the location of the card that has the op. So yes, if the bishop resides on an HRE card, then Inquisitor can move it to any other HRE card regardless of which side of players' tableaus contain those two cards."

Search the Market from left to right until you find a card with a matching Location (including The West or The East) that fulfills the criteria defined in O3c and O3d. For Bishops, search the opponent‚Äôs Tableau first, left to right, then yours.\n<br/>\n<br/>First of all, I'm assuming this refers to the location where the objective cell will be executed.  That being assumed, the concept of a \"location that achieves this objective by harming the player and helping the opponent\" seems remarkably subjective, given the complexity and subtlety of this game.  Is there an example someone could give of this in action?  I have been watching videos of Pax Ren games to help with learning and the one thing I have seen be consistent is the sensation that actions are far from black and white in terms of their ramifications.

The only option was for it to run its ops, using a siege to destroy a token in one of my kingdoms.  <br/><br/>With only one action left, the AI moved down to the final row and ran a trade fair, which simply replaced the token it had just removed with its siege.

The opponent‚Äôs rules seem to be geared toward preventing <i>anyone</i> from getting a religious win, unless it stumbles into such a situation in spite of itself.</i></div></div></font><br/>So here‚Äôs a specific example:<br/><br/>The opponent has 3 cards in its East tableau - Qizilbash (061) and Sahkulu Shi‚Äôite Revolt (115X) next to each other as well as Unified Christendom (100X). The first two have  Moslem bishops on them, the last has a Reform bishop. Hungary and Mamluk are both Islamic theocracies, each with one Moslem rook. The only other theocracy is the Papal States, with one Catholic rook, making Islam the Supreme religion. No comets have been triggered.<br/><br/>If the opponent had enough coin (it has none) it <i>could</i> buy a comet and win a holy victory, but according to the table it wouldn‚Äôt do so even if it could.<br/><br/>The first trigger is row 3. It can‚Äôt buy a card (no money) but it can siege either Hungary or Mamluk to even out the number of dominant religion agents.<br/><br/>After doing so, the second action triggers row 4. Again, the opponent can‚Äôt buy cards, but it can use inquisitor or sell a card (it can‚Äôt use behead because the card would have to behead itself, which is not permitted). So I played that it would use the inquisitor op to have the two Moslem bishops annihilate each other (which doesn‚Äôt make sense to me thematically but that‚Äôs what the Diet of Worms rule F1.a says).<br/><br/>Does this make sense within the parameters of the opponent‚Äôs AI?<br/><br/>Would it use behead to remove its own cards if the situation permitted? Since it always places bishops that seems to encourage self-sabotage.<br/>"

However, I think we might have done something wrong concerning running our East/West ops and, well, this might have changed a big part of the game play.<br/>When running east or west ops, what happens if one your cards does not alter the game state? Can you run that side of yours ops? We ruled that we couldn't but now I worry we might have understood the rules wrong. We thought that this was \"part\" of building a successful tableau to make sure that your cards did not become unplayable in the process.<br/>In relation to this, if indeed you can't run ops when one of the cards does not alter game state, can you still run your ops and use the inquisitor / behead actions to remove problematic cards from the \"ops queue\"?<br/>Thank you for your help."

If you use a campaign op on a king card, then later vote that king card into a republic, you can't use another op on that republic, since that 'card' has already been used during that \"run ops\" action.<br/><br/>I hope that helps!"

See point (d) under Vassal in the glossary: \"Return a Vassal to its Throne (retaining its Queen & Tokens if any) if sold (E3) or if its Suzerain suffers a REGIME CHANGE.\"<br/><br/>5. It can campaign right away. See E4.a: \"You may perform Ops on cards acquired as a result of Ops (e.g. campaigns), as long as it is in the proper (East or West) Tableau.\"<br/><br/>6. You simply do not place a concession in that case. Per point (a) under Regime Change in the glossary, the concession you gain from a regime change is not mandatory: \"If you cause a Regime Change, you always have the <b>option</b> to add one Pawn as a CONCESSION.\" (Emphasis mine.)<br/><br/>7. Correct. Even if you do have that ability, you still can't place a concession into a border where there's a pirate; the only way for them to coexist is if you have that ability and someone places a pirate into a border where there's already one of your concessions. See point (d) under Pirate in the glossary: \"If your Concessions cannot be Killed by Pirates due to an Ability, a Pirate placed on your Concession coexists with it, but cannot participate in trade fairs. However, you are still not allowed to place a new Concession into a Border containing a Pirate.\"<br/><br/>In case you're unaware, the latest living rules can be found <a href=\"https://assets.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:7d90cddd-5727-42f3-b056-3f57471aba3a?view=published\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.

Note that O3 says that where an objective cell in Table O8 has no objective but just one or more bullet points, these are performed in order if possible - which means that if the automa is following the row 7 course of action, it will try to do the first bullet point action (\"Trade Fair\") first, followed by \"West/East Ops commerce\", and only if it still has at least one action left will it then try to sell a card."

                "content": "OK.  This whole issue has started to obsess me, so I did a little research to see how prevalent the OP's situation might be.<br/><br/>According to the card database here in the BGG files, there are a total of 48 No-Battle One-Shots:  17 Coronations, 16 Trade Shifts and 15 Apostasies.  None of the Coronations places any Agents, so the question is irrelevant for them.  12 of the Apostasies place only Pirates or Bishops, both of which are placed for free and neither of which suppresses any other Agent.  So they are out.  6 of the Trade Shifts place only Pirates or 1 x Rook, neither of which will cause an issue (Pirates for the reason noted above and Rooks because of the point Daniel made in an earlier post).<br/><br/>So this leaves 13 potentially problematic cards (3 Apostasies and 10 Trade Shifts)<br/><br/>The apostasies are Santa Hermandad (1 x Knight: The West), Marechaussee (1 x Rook: The West) and Swabian League (2 x Knight: HRE).  The first two are only an issue if every single one of the 6 western locations is saturated.  Possible, but not likely.  On the other hand, I can see Swabian League potentially requiring a player to suppress Agents in HRE.<br/><br/>As for the 10 Trade Shift cards, 9 of them require the placement of a Pawn.  The other one (Conquistadors) requires the placement of 2 x Knights, which like Swabian League can potentially be problematic.<br/><br/>So in summary, I think players will likely not face the OP's situation in any given game, but there is definitely a chance of it occurring.<br/><br/>As for the answer to the OP's question, based on the wording of the Pax Renaissance rules dated March 11, 2021 I would stick to my earlier response.  Based on the wording, agents must be deployed and if they can't be, then the player cannot implement the One-Shot (this assumes, of course, that the March 11 rules are the latest iteration of the Living Rules).<br/><br/>Probably an issue that someone should bring up with Phil and the gang at Ion Games.<br/><br/>"

No Battle</b>: If the One shot is a trade shift or coronation, there is no Battle and its Agent(s) must be deployed.  See <b>E2.2</b> below for placement details\".<br/><br/>Is there a more recent version of the Living Rules that you are referencing?  By the way, it is clear that Apostasy should also be added along with trade shift and coronations as One-Shots without battle.</i></div></div></font><br/>Yes, there is a more recent version. From the Pax Renaissance page on Ion's website, I assume you got to the rules you're looking at by clicking the link that reads, \"DOWNLOADABLE RULES Pax Renaissance 2nd Edition book 1,\" and which leads to the following PDF, which is a downloadable version of the Living Rules that was current as of the date you gave, and which contains the wording you quoted:<br/><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f9lgr6zcptm2pz4/AAADCP-sZLxpC0USjaQZ2Sbla?dl=0&preview=PRen2+Rules+BOOK+I.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f9lgr6zcptm2pz4/AAADCP-sZLxpC0USj...</a><br/><br/>From that same page on Ion's website, if you click the link that reads, \"Living rules and other files, administrated by respective game designer,\" then you arrive at a non-downloadable version of the rules that is open for anyone to comment on, and which contains comments from Phil that are dated after March 11, 2021, and <i>that</i> version of the rules contains the text that I quoted:<br/><a href=\"https://assets.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:7d90cddd-5727-42f3-b056-3f57471aba3a?view=published\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://assets.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:7d90cddd-5727-42f...</a><br/><br/>My understanding is that the second link is the most up-to-the-minute document, while the first is a version of that document that was saved off as a PDF in the past. Complicating the chronology is the fact that Phil's comment about having rewritten E2.1b for clarity is dated December 13, 2020, which suggests that his rewrite ought to be visible in your PDF, but since <i>both</i> of the documents linked above differ from the printed rulebook in how they word E2.1b, my best guess is that Phil rewrote it in December 2020, that this rewrite was captured in March 2021 to create the PDF you're referring to, and that E2.1b was revised again sometime subsequently, but without an accompanying note in the living rules.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the living rules I quoted are the most recent document, as Phil is still actively replying to suggestions in there and making changes when appropriate. But I don't know how to square the response that you got from him with the inclusion of the phrase \"if there is space for it\" in the latest version of E2.1b. I think I'll leave a suggestion directly in the rules document asking for a clarification on this point."

The same issue applies to them.  Joe Farrell has gone to the Living Rules and asked Phil to confirm what he told me yesterday.  The latest Living Rules do seem to indicate the same thing as the Russian rules.  That being said, in my opinion it is a fiddly exception to the overarching rule that agents MUST be placed if the one-shot occurs.  It also adds another interesting dilemma; if you have a saturated map card (either Knights, Rooks or Pawns), shouldn't the implementation of a one-shot event \"shake things up\" on that map card, causing some disgruntled (i.e., repressed) agents?  That is how I view things."

Then, Marchionni launched the Qizilbash in a jihad against the Ottomans. Now historically, the Qizilbash were Shi'ites, and the Ottomans were Sunnis. In the game, however, there appears to be no functional difference. The only reason Marchionni could even launch the jihad was that there was one Catholic rook in Rhodes. So in game terms, Marchionni's Qizilbash targeted the Catholic rook, but thereby snagged the Ottoman Empire from Coeur through a regime change...if I'm playing correctly. I placed the new Islamic Theocracy card on the map. <br/><br/>Does that all sound kosher? The really weird part is that the Qizilbash actually used the Ottomans' own green pieces against itself, since they were, in game terms, believers. "

The Bektashi order had a long history of popularity with the Janissary corps - this being one of the reasons for their eventual abolition in the early 1800s - and Hacƒ± Bekta≈ü Veli was revered by both the Qizilbash and Bektashis.

This turned Papal States to its Reformed version, in which Venice is printed as home to 1 red rook.<br/><br/>There are a few cards with the passive effect of allowing Venice to hold 2 gold knights instead of just 1. At least one of these was in another player's tableau. While it never ended up being relevant (no trade voyages passed through Italy for the remainder of the game, and Venice was simply empty), we were unsure about how the Reformation map of Italy and this card would interact. Basically, is there only 1 space in Italy? Are there two spaces, e.g. a red rook AND a gold knight? Is there a possibility of a red rook and TWO gold knights?<br/><br/>We assumed that the passive ability on the card would simply be moot until Venice was once again Catholic by default - but please advise, so we have certainty next time it happens!"

The issue is moot with respect to trade voyages since the levy would be a red rook; there are no Gold Knight levies if the Papal States are Reformed.<br/><br/>However, if you do play Wolf of Rimini or Gonfalnier (both of which have 2 Gold Knights as agents), I can see an interpretation where BOTH of these agents could be placed in the Papal States along with the Red Rook, making the Papal States a potential powerhouse with 3 Agents.  <br/><br/>Not sure if this was Phil's intention, but it would be consistent with the rules as they are currently stated."

One (Aragon-Papal states) has sea access to an Ottoman border, but the other (France-HRE) doesn't. <br/><br/>My interpretation of the rules is that the only \"bordering pirates\" of the Ottoman Empire are pirates in the Papal States-Ottoman, HRE-Ottoman and Mamluk-Ottoman Empire borders, and not those on any border of an adjacent empire, but I just want to make sure I'm getting the definition of bordering pirates properly.

It just illustrates a couple of the ways that a bishop can move. From the throne of England, with a single move, the bishop could move onto any of three other cards shown in the example: Reformed Theology because its location (West) matches that of the throne of England, Star Chamber because it's both adjacent to the throne of England <i>and</i> has a matching location (either of the two reasons would be enough on its own), or the throne of Portugal because of F1d: \"A Bishop on a Suzerain may move to any of its Vassals. A Bishop on a Vassal may move to its Suzerain or one of the Suzerain‚Äôs other Vassals (if any).\""

Or, do they just count as one (combined) since they've been joined in holy matrimony?<br/>B) If I have a card with a location of \"East\" or \"West\" I understand I can choose a location in that region for any target-based actions...

It really does work well two-handed; I hope you feel the same when you give it a try."

An apostasy does not trigger a regime change but just let them discarded. So, the dominating empire went back to its throne. Then, what should be happening to its vassal?<br/><br/>2. I bought a card with a trade shift one-shot(Spice Islands), which requires a discovery prestige. Let‚Äôs say on the purchased card, there is a discovery prestige as well. As playing the card, can I make the one-shot happening using the card‚Äôs prestige, or do I need one already in my tableau?<br/><br/>Thanks!"

                "content": "Hi,<br/><br/>I am a newbie to Pax Ren. After a first game some questions came up.<br/><br/>1. Gonfalonier - the rulebook page 27 example says the card allows me to place both knights into Venice since the Papal States is currently a Catholic Theocracy. However, I do not see this prerequisite condition on the card. Is Papal States to be a Catholic to place both? Why?<br/><br/>2. When placing a unit on the map via a Levy or a card play, are we allowed to put a unit on a city with a busted disc?<br/><br/>3. This is not an actual question. On page 37, example of supreme religion says the muslim pirate between Ottoman and Mamluk is counted twice. The supremacy condition says ‚Äòmore tokens‚Äô of its color in play in its Theocracies. It is easily perceived as the the number of the physical tokens should be higher than the others. I am just thinking if it would have been clearer just to make the rule like that, so for that example on page 37 we need actual 2 muslim tokens(for instance, 2 pirates) instead of 1. Just my thought.<br/><br/>4. I think the answer is going to be yes, but just to make sure I am asking to you guys. Is it Ok to trigger a civil war(or any kinds of one-shot) even though I knew it would never be successful, but just to get the empire weaker?<br/><br/>5. Cards and empire squares in a tableau. Is the order how they sit important because of movement of bishop? I saw in the forum that people asked if the empire square should go to the end of west/east tableau depends on the situation. Then, once I put an empire square at the end of west tableau, for example, then I get and play a card which belongs to west, which is correct? A) locate the card next to the empire square so that the card is now at the end of row, or B) move the empire square to the end to make a room for the card.<br/><br/>6. When emancipating repressed units in a newly conquered empire, let‚Äôs say there are a knight and a pawn of another player‚Äôs color. When releasing them on to the map, is the pawn becoming my color(giving it back to the owner, then placing mine instead)?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>I believe this game keeps giving me doubting in rules during future plays as well. You guys can soon find another silly questions from me. Thanks in advance for all of your valuable answers."

Suggestions for clearing this rule up (and restoring the age-old previous rule of yes, the empires move) were submitted to Phil. Not sure if he's implemented the yet but I would definitely play that way regardless because the rule stating they don't move is inconsistent/opens more logic holes than are necessary."

You can only run west ops once per turn, and east ops once per turn. The special abilities that let you run either side of your tableau without expending an action, or both sides as a single action, do not supersede that restriction.<br/><br/>So, on your turn you can run east ops without expending an action. You could then use one of your two actions to run west ops, but you wouldn't get to run your east ops again. Your third action would have to be used for something other than ops.<br/><br/>In essence, once you have either of the two abilities you've cited, adding the second one doesn't give you a whole lot extra. You get some redundancy, in that someone wanting to take away your free ops would have to behead or silence two cards instead of one. And the \"free east ops\" card is somewhat more flexible than the other one because it doesn't require you to spend an action and thus permits more combinations of actions on your turn. But that's it."

Since that action wasn‚Äôt expanded by the free ability </i></div></div></font><br/>Yes, you essentially have three actions every turn, but no, you can't use them in that way. You can only run west ops once per turn, and east ops once per turn. The special abilities that let you run either side of your tableau without expending an action, or both sides as a single action, do not supersede that restriction.<br/><br/>So, on your turn you can run east ops without expending an action. You could then use one of your two actions to run west ops, but you wouldn't get to run your east ops again. Your third action would have to be used for something other than ops.<br/><br/>In essence, once you have either of the two abilities you've cited, adding the second one doesn't give you a whole lot extra. You get some redundancy, in that someone wanting to take away your free ops would have to behead or silence two cards instead of one. And the \"free east ops\" card is somewhat more flexible than the other one because it doesn't require you to spend an action and thus permits more combinations of actions on your turn. But that's it.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Wait wait wait... you're saying that if you use ‚Äúyou may do activate eastern ops without expending an action‚Äù you've still wasted your opportunity to then do a tableau ops to the east? you just have the action credit remaining, but not the ability to run that same thing again?<br/><br/>If that's so, does that also mean you're now out of the ability to enjoy \"May do east & west ops in one action‚Äù because that was printed on an East card and you'd have to activate Tableau ops East in order to enjoy that ability?<br/><br/>And finally, just to make sure i understand the actions that are allowed only once per turn.  Can you just not repeat the same thing, but you're allowed to run it in either direction.  Example: you can run both trade fair east and trade fair west in the same turn, you just can't run trade fair east twice? The same way you'd sell a card twice which is allowed in the same turn? Same for Tableau ops.  You can run east and west as two different actions, but can't repeat Tableau ops east twice in a row in the same turn?<br/>"

Abilities are always active as long as they're in play and not silenced; whether they appear on the west or east side of your tableau is irrelevant. You don't need to run ops in order to activate the card abilities in that side of your tableau. Running ops just lets you activate up to one op on each card on one side of your tableau. Abilities are not ops.<br/><br/>The reason the \"west and east ops in one action\" ability is no longer useful once you've run the \"east ops without spending an action\" ability is that, per D1, you cannot run east ops twice in one turn. So the effect of the \"west and east ops in one action\" ability is exactly the same as just running west ops normally.<br/><br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>schone wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>And finally, just to make sure i understand the actions that are allowed only once per turn.

Attackers and defenders are determined by a Battle‚Äôs type (see<br/>campaign (F9), Civil War (J1, J2), and Religious War (K)). All eligible Tokens must fight (Bishops<br/>never fight in a Battle).<br/>b. Eliminate attackers & defenders. Each attacking Token Kills one defending Token but is itself<br/>Killed in exchange. The attacking player chooses all casualties. The Battle is Victorious if any attackers<br/>survive.<br/>c. Placement. Any surviving Agents or Repressed Tokens used as attackers in a Battle must be placed in<br/>the conquered Empire (until it is Saturated). Knights and Rooks go into empty Cities (ignoring the City<br/>icon), Pirate ships go into empty Sea Borders, and Pawns (including Serfs) go into empty Borders.

I do have 2 big questions about how this new language provides clarity on the regime change rules:<br/><br/>1‚ÄìIt is completely unclear if this new language refers to the positioning of the empire square (furthest east or west), the empire square being placed as a king, or both. It makes sense that a regime change on an empire square in your tableau doesn't result in a king, however...<br/>2‚ÄìIf the revised language refers to both which side is face up and where the empire square is positioned, a vassal in your tableau wouldn't be moved to the farthest east or west position of your tableau after a strawman regime change, they would stay under their suzerain right? So unless additional language has been added that I missed, this makes a single rule for how to deal with empire square positioning after regime changes need 2 exceptions (don't move it if it is already in your tableau, unless it is a vassal in which case you should). Seems unnecessarily complicated to me.<br/><br/>Of course, I would argue what is really needed is an overhaul of the regime change entry entirely to include specifics about strawman regime changes and strawman coronations. This is what I included in my rules rewrite:<br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Van rules rewrite wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>To resolve a Regime Change: <br/><b>a.  External.</b> If the targeted Empire Square is outside your Tableau (either in its Throne or an opponent‚Äôs Tableau), move the Empire Square to your Tableau on its King side, in the furthest East or West position as appropriate (or below its Suzerain in the case of a successful campaign, see F9g). <br/><b>b.  Strawman.</b> If the targeted Empire Square is already in your Tableau, flip the Empire Square to its opposite side (i.e. from King to Republic or Republic to King), and move it to the furthest East or West position as appropriate. A Strawman Regime Change is the only way to create a Republic (you are not allowed to campaign against an Empire in your own Tableau, see F9a). <br/>...<br/><b>i.  Strawman Coronation. </b>Coronation on a King already in your tableau causes a special kind of Regime Change called a Strawman Coronation. Strawman Coronations allow you the option of placing a Concession and/or Emancipating Repressed Tokens in the targeted Empire but do not alter the King‚Äôs position in your tableau, flip the Empire Square, Discard a Bishop, or change the status of Suzerains/Vassals.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>In summary, I'm happy for the ruling to be that strawman regime changes only change the position of the empire square if it was a vassal in your tableau, however, to make that the case the rules need additional work/clarification (and we need to all accept that the rules will be more complicated than they already are). Restructuring the regime change entry like I've shown above makes that clarification much easier to make.<br/>"

Yes if you gain an east king it's placed to the right of the rightmost card, no matter if it's a king or not (even if you flipped a card from king to republic or vice versa in your own tableau, it would move to the outermost space in the wing it's located). If it was a west king it would go furthest to the left in the west side of the tableau. In both cases together with the queen card if it was a coronation or you gained them as a couple from the throne. The only exception to this placement rule I can think of is if you gain it as a vasall, it's then placed directly underneath it's suzerain to denote this suzerain/vasell relationship. Not that while an inquisitor suppresses both cards in a royal couple, it does not suppress both suzerain and vasall. However it can be moved between them, and laterally in the tableau following regular movement rules.<br/><br/>2. New cards (including king cards, except the above mentioned example) are always placed at the outmost space on that side of the tableau. It's helpful to think of the king cards as just any other tableau card, except where it's explicitly stated that they have different rules (coronations, beheadings and such).<br/><br/>Edit: As I forgot to refresh the page, I didn't see the questions were already answered.

Place it directly on the Tableau card played. Alternatively, you may place it on any Tableau card (even in an opponent‚Äôs Tableau) or Throne that has the same Location as the Tableau card being played. (See LOCATION.) If you place it on a card with a Token, apply the Diet of Worms rule (F1a) or the pacification rule (F1b)‚Äú</i>.<br/><br/>Why wouldn‚Äòt the A.I. place the Bishop on a player‚Äòs tableau card, silencing the card and thereby hurting the player?

Cost. If you repress as a result of Agent placement (E2.2) or a Regime Change, the cost is 1 Florin paid to China.<br/>b. Gain. If you repress as the result of the repress op (F5), you gain 1 Florin from China.<br/>c. Free. If you repress as a result of the tax op (F4) or trade shift (H1), there is no cost or gain. If there are more Victorious survivors after a Battle than Cities or Borders to house them, repress them for no cost.<br/>d. Serfs. The Location of a card used to repress a Concession determines which Empire it enters as a Serf."

I didn't realize that you could repress any unit when placing agents nor that you had to pay to do so.

I understand the Victorious survivors condition as well; basically you choose what goes on the map and what becomes repressed (or remains repressed). The serf concept is oddly specific but very useful for clarifying where pawns go - I have had the question before but intuited the answer correctly.<br/><br/>Thanks for the response!"

If there are tokens already in the City or Border you choose, then you must pay 1 Florin to Repress each token (exception: you can't place Pawn Agents into a Sea Border occupied by a Pirate). Agent placement in this context is totally independent of whether or not an Empire is Saturated.<br/><br/>Using your last example: Playing a card with 2 Rook Agents and a Location in an Empire with 3 Cities, only one of which is occupied, you could place 1 Rook into an empty City and the other into the occupied City, paying 1 Florin to Repress the Token there. You could alternately place only one of Rooks, choosing the occupied City, and paying 1 Florin to Repress."

Yes, per the glossary entry for BATTLE, Agents and Repressed Tokens used as attackers during a battle must be placed until saturation. Any excess are Repressed for free (attacker's choice which are Repressed and which are placed). Note that this language specifically leaves out adjacent Knights from Campaigns and Holy Wars since they always return home (you're probably clear on that but just emphasizing since it can be misunderstood)<br/><br/>2. While an Empire Square is in your tableau you can place one of your heraldic shield tokens in the corresponding Throne slot so it is easy to scan the board and know in whose Tableau and Empire Square resides.<br/><br/>3. Yes, card abilities are are always active once in your tableau unless silenced (glossary BISHOP, b and F1g state that Bishops silence (i.e. inactivate) all Abilities and Ops of the card they are on except for inquisitor ops and abilities granting immunity from silencing.<br/><br/>4. Correct, glossary TOKEN MANAGEMENT, \"If during card play or adding a Levy you wish to place a Token but none remains, you may remove the necessary Tokens from any Repressed Tokens, or (if this is not possible) from any position.\" I've had this happen 2 or 3 times, once with my Concessions and a couple of times with Catholic Knights. It can change the board state significantly.<br/><br/>5. Correct, City symbols (type and color) only matter for Levies (trade fairs and the Tax op), not for Agent<br/>placement, placing victorious attackers, or emancipation.<br/><br/>Seems like you have a great grasp on the rules so keep it up. I've answered these and many other commonly asked questions in the <a  href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/233036/unofficial-revised-pax-renaissance-2nd-edition-rul\"   >unofficial rules document</a> that I made (/shameless plug).

My \"genius\" opponent (his word!) played \"Epicurean Swerve,\" \"Artistic Geometry,\" and \"Consent of the Governed\" by the third turn or so. A comet appeared <i>as early as possible</i> (it was the top of the 14 eligible cards), and he swiftly won a \"Renaissance,\" i.e., Republic, Victory: according to the card, \"Epicurean Swerve\" itself counts as a Republic; no one had any <i>other</i> republics, in fact, hardly anyone had kingdoms (due to an odd combination of cards early on). It was a swift and comical end. (The other two cards provided the necessary law symbols.) <br/><br/>Did we play right? It occurred to us that perhaps \"Epicurean Swerve\" was intended to count as an <i>additional</i> republic, but not in lieu of any republics, but we could not find explicit rules to that effect. Or perhaps this is just one of those things, a dangerous combination that a skilled player should see and know to guard against? Thoughts? Thanks for reading. "

With four very different potential victory conditions, richly varied cards and so many different ways in which they can appear and combine, there's always the danger that an early comet can lead to a quick win.  You need to keep a close eye on everyone's position (much easier to say than to do, of course!), including remembering the cards they've purchased for later play.  <br/><br/>In this case with few kingdoms in players' tableaus, the standard defence of using a strawman to create your own republic might be tricky; some other possibilities depending on the cards available might include beheading the Epicurean Swerve, or buying time by silencing it with a Bishop.  If all else fails you'd need to buy the comet yourself, assuming you have the chance to do so before your opponent.<br/><br/>Great game!"

You MAY repress existing tokens if you want, paying 1 florin for each repressed token.<br/><br/>Option 2) Trigger the one-shot. In this case, the attacking agents are placed next to the target (but not in any slots yet) (you must use all eligible attackers, including all agents) (bishops are not attackers and are placed at the very last step, and can pacify repressed tokens if placed on an empire card), and you resolve the battle immediately with 1:1 casualties. IF you have any surviving attackers, they must go to an open, available space. If there are no open spaces, the surviving attacker(s) is repressed for free. Then, when placing your new pawn during Regime Change, you may pay 1 to repress an existing pawn.<br/><br/>The rules are a bit scattered throughout the rulebook, but look up the the rule for <b>Play Hand Card & Place Agents</b> (E2) on page 14 of the rulebook, <b>Civil Wars</b> (J1, J2) on page 32, <b>Religious Wars </b> (K1, K2) on page 34, and <b>Regime Change</b> in the glossary on page 41. Regarding regime change, I wish the glossary entry included what to do in the case of a Strawman attack, as well as a Strawman Coronation...the rules for those are presumably written elsewhere in the rulebook (but aren't relevant to your specific example anyway).<br/><br/>Someone should really write a flowchart for all this...<br/><br/>For a cleaner presentation of the rules, with lots of the relevant bits grouped together so you don't have to chase things down, I recommend Vantastic's rules rewrite here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/233036/unofficial-revised-pax-renaissance-2nd-edition-rul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/233036/unofficial-revised...</a>"

In this case, the queen and king return to the throne as a single card.

Shorter short answer is like Kevin responded, in all 3 Vassal examples you've shown the Queen and bishop are retained as the Vassal returning to its throne is not due to it experiencing a regime change.<br/><br/>Very astute questions. I think the confusion arises from the way these rules are split up and/or repeated across multiple glossary entries. <br/><br/>My short answers to your questions are:<br/><strike>1) No, Queens and Bishops are not retained in case #3  (i.e. Regime Changes), regardless of Suzerain/Vassal status</strike><br/>1) Yes, the Queen and Bishop of the Vassal are retained in case #3 since the Vassal did not experience the Regime Change itself and was moved as the result of the Suzerain's Regime Change (see answer to #3 below).<br/>2) Repressed Tokens are never discarded as a result of moving an Empires Square<br/>3) A Vassal returning to its throne is not considered a Regime Change<br/><br/>More detail behind the rationale for each of the short answers above:<br/>Another edit:<br/>1) Empire Squares undergoing a Regime Change are never returned to their throne as the result of a Regime Change. Regime Changes do not result in the discard of empire squares, rather they move empire squares <i>from</i> their throne or another Tableau <i>to</i> your Tableau, or flip an empire square in your Tableau).  In the case of Vassals whose Suzerain undergoes a Regime Change, the Vassal returns to its throne, but does not experience a Regime Change itself and so the Queen and bishop are retained. <br/><br/>Subsequently, the language about Regime Change in <b>DISCARD a).</b> isn't applicable (and should be removed). What seems to have happened here is a copying of language from other sections (e.g. the glossary entry for QUEEN) that detail the two instances when Queens are discarded. The way I teach it is that Bishops and Queens 1) follow Empire Squares to and from the throne, except for Queens in the case of beheading, and 2) are discarded in Regime Changes.<br/><br/>2) Per the glossary entry for REPRESSED TOKEN, \"If an Empire Square with Repressed Tokens moves, the Repressed Tokens remain on the tile.\" You have correctly identified the instances when these tokens may be affected though (Civil Wars, emancipation, pacification).<br/><br/>3) Again, returning a Vassal (or any empire square) to its throne is not a Regime Change. While in the case of Vassals this may have been initiated by the Regime Change of a Suzerain, the Vassal itself has not undergone a Regime Change.<br/><br/>If I've misunderstood some of your questions or my responses don't make sense, let me know, happy to discuss more.<br/>  "

But as the second step the initiator takes the first florin, so in a 1/2 player game you kinda take that one florin you added from china anyway for yourself. In the 3/4 player game you immediately take one of those two florin just added. I can see why some videos just take them from china directly to their own deposit. But you only take one florin for yourself no matter what. The next one might go to an opponents concession or a pirate."

Which surviving attackers are placed on the map and which are repressed is the choice of the player instigating the battle so, if I'm understanding your second question correctly, there is no need for the situation you've proposed.<br/><br/>To be clear, all of this is totally independent of emancipation (REGIME CHANGE part b), the optional placement of repressed tokens in a conquered empire after a regime change (including those caused by Victorious battles), which only allows for placement of repressed tokens into empty cities and borders in the empire (and so isn't applicable in the situation you've described since the cities are saturated)."

My interpretation of the rules as written is that, no, this isn‚Äôt allowed. This is for 2 reasons, 1) the placement rules for battle we have been discussing specifically refer to agents and repressed tokens, neither of which is on the map before the battle and 2) K2a specifically states that ‚ÄúAll Ruling Class remain in the same cities (Attacker‚Äôs choice in the case of Constantinople).‚Äù<br/><br/>This also allows for the basic rule to remain that battles never result in tokens moving on the map (some die and new ones can be placed but they aren‚Äôt moved from point A to point B)."

However, the detailed rules for each type of battle (F9 and K1 in this case) provide full clarity as it seems you've surmised.<br/><br/>For campaigns, only knights in the Kingdom where the campaign op is located participate as attackers. However, those knights are, by definition, adjacent to the battle location since you use the campaign op to \"create a Battle in a defending Empire Adjacent to the King's Location (adjacency includes diagonals).\"<br/><br/>Separately, all \"Knights in Adjacent Locations (Believers only)\" to the targeted empire participate in a religious war one-shot.

Hopefully the living rules are updated, but until that happens, here is the ruling from the Ion discord:<br/><i><br/>For the slave soldiers, as I remember, the ability was inspired by the use of Mamluks in the scorpion dynastic war in Cypress, where the Mamluk ruler was paid to deploy his soldiers. so I had in mind used as knights in any campaign in the East. The campaign used mamluks but was Not a Mamluk campaign to expand the Mamluk empire. Somehow I have to add this clarification to rules somehow.<br/><br/>Yes, [this works in] any campaign against the East. Even Mamluk itself (which would be a slave revolt situation rather than slave mercenaries for hire).</i><br/><br/>So essentially, whoever has this ability gets to add any repressed tokens in Mamluk to their campaign strength when targeting an eastern empire (and choose them as casualties) - regardless of who actually controls Mamluk."

What if the monarch gets flipped, does the bishop get removed?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance!</i></div></div></font><br/>Great questions, answers from my understanding of the <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f9lgr6zcptm2pz4/AAADCP-sZLxpC0USjaQZ2Sbla?dl=0&preview=PRen2+Rules+BOOK+I.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">current rules</a> are as follows (please correct me folks if I'm wrong!):<br/><br/>1. Yes a bishop can be placed on an unclaimed empire square in its throne. Regarding their movement from thrones, remember 2 things: a) per F1c you may not move a bishop on a throne directly to another throne (i.e. they don't move adjacently between thrones like they would tableau cards) and b) per F1, bishops can move to another card that has the same location as the one it currently sits on (in any tableau or throne). This means that a Bishop on a throne could be moved to any tableau card with that empire square's same location using the inquisitor action.<br/><br/>2. Correct, if there is no opponent tableau where your bishop can be placed, you must place the bishop in your own tableau (often the card that causes the bishop placement). However, remember from your question #1 that you can also place bishops on empire squares in their thrones. Assuming you don't have the empire square matching the bishop's location in your tableau, that is another option. Whether you want to place them in your own tableau, the throne, or an opponent's tableau will depend greatly on the board state. Sometimes you really need to protect those bishops for a religious victory (or preventing an opponent's) and the best way is keeping them in your tableau.<br/><br/>3. Yes, republics are part of your tableau and can be silenced by bishops just like kings. Bishops are discarded as part of strawman regime changes (see the glossary entry for Regime Change, section d, \"If the Empire Square comes from its THRONE, it comes with its Bishop (if any) and Queen (if any). If the Empire Square comes from an enemy Tableau, or if it is flipped in your own Tableau (see STRAWMAN), Bishops and Queens are Discarded and any Vassals returned to their Thrones.\" So in your example, the bishop would be discarded."

I hope that you are enjoying them.<br/><br/>In a game as complex as Pax Renaissance it is almost impossible to put together rules that address every possible contingency.  As I developed the solo rules, I was very impressed with the job Jose Cunha did to minimize these situations.<br/><br/>That being said, these situations do arise at various times.  In many cases, it is usually clear which course of action is better for the bot.  If not, then I generally just randomly choose from the various options.<br/><br/>It has been several months since I have looked at the Pax Renaissance rules (solo or otherwise).  Probably time for me to refresh my memory since my copy of Pax Renaissance should be arriving this weekend!"

I will likely review the rules this weekend after I (hopefully) receive the 2nd edition.<br/><br/>As for your questions: you are correct with regard to the second question; you place the agents at the normal time.<br/>With respect to your first question, I will have to review the trigger to make sure it works the way it should.<br/><br/>In any case, keep playing the solo game!  I have found that the narratives from the solo game are very interesting.  Furthermore, it isn't very easy to beat the solo bot.  There were a couple of solo games where I thought I had the bot dead to rights, but it did something unexpected (as per the solo rules) and pulled out the victories.  Kind of embarrassing when the solo bot plays the turn better than I would have!"

Now the \"player\" had its own pawn repressed on a kingdom card in its tableau.\n<br/>My question:\n<br/>1) It is a legal move? can one's pawn be repressed on a kingdom card that is held in one's tableau?\n<br/>2) How can the pawn be released? I remember that releasing a repressed piece takes 1 florin, but as far as I know it happens in a regime change and not at any turn in which you own your own repressed pawn in your tableau?\n<br/>3) A more general question: can the Operations (such as Corsair, Tax, Commerce, Campaign, etc. - not the one shot) be operate only in the kingdom/region mentioned on the card or anywhere on the board (as in Pax Pamir's operations of tableau cards)?\n<br/>\n<br/>Thank you!"

There is slight room for doubt in the rules, but it seems to me fairly clear that just like for any other regime change, emancipation is optional, and moreover you can definitely only do it if there are empty Cities (for knights or rooks) or Borders (for pawns) in the location (the Vote example on p.23 of the rules shows a scenario in which none of the serfs are emancipated following the Vote because the Borders are full).<br/><br/>The room for doubt arises because in the Glossary under Repressed Token it says ‚ÄúEach [Repressed Token] increases the cost of a vote in an Empire by 1 Florin, and are Emancipated by the vote.  Each can fight in certain Battles and may be Emancipated.‚Äù This gives the impression that Emancipation following a Vote might be more automatic than Emancipation following other actions.  However, the section in the main rules on Vote makes no specific mention of Emancipation and simply says ‚ÄúDemocratic Events.  See REGIME CHANGE.‚Äù  The Glossary entry for REGIME CHANGE then describes Emancipation but makes no distinction between Emancipation following a vote and other Emancipations, saying simply that ‚ÄúIf you cause a Regime Change ‚Ä¶ you may move any or all of the Repressed Tokens from the Empire Square onto its Map Location (into either empty Cities for Rooks or Knights, or into its empty Borders for Concessions).‚Äù<br/><br/>In view of this we have always played that all Emancipations are optional ‚Äì but I‚Äôm willing to be corrected if someone gives an official view to the contrary.<br/>"

I am not a fan of the (new to 2e) rule that bishops are discarded off an empire square during certain regime changes - not a fan at all. But the Diet of Worms rule is fine - it's the main way to get a pesky bishop off your card or to stop a religious dominance win. Makes the difficulty in achieving that type of win suitably challenging IMO.<br/><br/>Also, the only card that puts out 2 bishops (Oratory of Divine Love) is a Papal States card - so the targeted bishops should have been put well enough away from Papal States and/or the West (NEVER leave a bishop that you want to protect on a West or East card). You could have seen this coming - you will next time!"

The puppeted card retains all its limitations (e.g. cannot behead itself, Killed if beheads an Empire Square, can be silenced, etc.). The card retains its Location, so the Op occurs in the Location of the card stolen from.Example: Your opponent has a coronated pair in Portugal including Isabella of Castile, who has a Behead Op.  You use Cryptography on Isabella to murder her husband and send the Empire Square back to its Throne. The widow Isabella is Discarded."

After a successful battle, even before resolving the regime change, you must place in the Empire any surviving agents and any repressed tokens that fought in the battle, repressing for free any of them for which there is no space.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you decide not to activate the one-shot (or if it is a one-shot that doesn't initiate a battle) you may decide to put its agents in play right away; if you decide to place an agent in a city or a border occupied by another token, you must repress it at the cost of a florin. <br/><br/>So in your example,  when you play the french card, you can:<br/>1) decide to activate the Conspiracy one-shot; in this case the knight agent fights in the battle, killing the rook or the knight in France (assuming there are no other attaking pieces, the conspiracy fails because there is still one defender and no more attackers);<br/>2) decide not to activate the one-shot; in this case you may decide to deploy the agent knight in the last remaining unoccupied french city, or pay 1 florin and place it in the place of an existing piece, which you repress;<br/>3) just play the card, ignoring both agents and the one-shot. <br/><br/>Hope this helps!"

In this case my understanding is the Levy must be placed in the Ottoman Location, and cannot be placed more generally in any \"The East\" because the opponent is not the phasing player and selected \"The East\" card to behave as an \"Ottoman\" card.  This seems correct, but I have a doubt and when pressured in a Win/Loss situation one wants to look for the most flexible interpretation... <br/><br/>Since the glossary states you \"can consider\" not \"must consider\" can the Tax op be applied more generally to the entire region? Two examples: <br/>1) Assume Ottomans are already full of tokens, would taxing the concession bordering the Ottomans and The Papal States allow for a levy to be placed in an empty location in The East, outside of the Ottomans? <br/><br/>2) Lets say there was room in the Ottomans and it had been converted to a Muslim Theocracy, and the opponent wanted to avoid placing a Levy in the Ottoman location (because on the next turn they would loose to a Holy Victory), could the opponent select another The East location even though they are not the phasing player, or do they get to choose since the concession owner always selects the Levy and thereby momentarily makes an \"in-phase\" decision? For this one also assume the border is Ottomans and The Papal States<br/><br/>3) Would anything change with respect to the above answers if the selected concession was not on an East/West shared border but on an East/East border?<br/><br/>Thanks very much"

The East/West card can thereafter gain a different Location specificity in subsequent Ops actions.  Furthermore, a \"The East/The West\" card cannot be treated, for Ops purposes, as an entire region having simultaneously all internal and external borders of the broader geography defined by East or West. In other words, Ops can only ever be executed as an Empire location, and executing Ops as a broader East/West overall region AND maintaining Empire ambiguity is NOT permitted.<br/><br/>Shorter:<br/>When executing Ops the phasing player will determine the Empire Location of \"The East/The West\" card, in any Tableau, required for the Op to be executed.

It isn't explicitly stated that Strawman Regime Changes can only result in Republics or that they can result in Republics flipping to kings. However, given that the Battle Table on the player aid indicates that Strawman Regime Changes result in flipping the empire card (but not specifying that it is only flipped to a Republic) and the 1st edition rules clearly indicate that for Regime Changes, \"if the Empire is in your own Tableau, flip it to its other side\" it seems to me that the most reasonable interpretation is that Strawman Regime Changes flip an empire square in your tableau, regardless of its current state.<br/><br/>Likely the oversight results from the fact that Strawman Regime Changes are the only way to form Republics and that voting is one of the most common ways to pursue a Strawman Regime Change on a Republic in your tableau (since it leaves your empire stronger against attacks than other methods of bringing about a Strawman Regime Change‚Äîvoting spends florins rather than tokens and requires concession majority which previous successful Strawman Regime Changes help to achieve)."

Empire Squares as considered to be Cards <b>only</b> when they are in your tableau. So your quotes of the glossary actually give you a very straight answer. Moving or discarding a <b>Card </b> (including Empires in your own tableau) will have the Bishop follow. The Bishop will be discarded if coming from another Tableau or if you flip an Empire in your own.<br/><br/>So, in the case of a Coronation in your own Tableau - Regime Change that does NOT flip your Empire Square - the Bishop remains (immediately silencing the Royal Couple).<br/><br/>Note that in addition to that, if you check Glossary entry BISHOP, you are reminded that Bishops not only do not Battle, but cannot be Repressed either. Which means that moving back an Empire to its throne (by any means) will also discard the Bishop."

Would then he have to kill one of his concession or does the ability grant him immunity?\n<br/>\n<br/>Moreover, after this, does the imperial arsenal ability stops pirate ships to be played and moved into the player concession spots?

Is it up to the active player to decide which attackers to remove as casualities or is there any priority or rule to follow? I mean, can I remove attackers from the adjacent empires so that I don‚Äôt have to sacrifice the agents received and could add them to the newly conquered empire? If yes, such holy war can also be used to weaken the neighbour empires sacrificing their units when conducting a holy war. Do I interpret this well or am I maybe missing something important in the related rules??\n<br/>Thank you in advance for any response."

We play that your turn isn't over until you declare you are done with all actions and refresh the market. I don't know of anything in the rules that specifies this explicitly but D2 says \"If there are gaps in the Market after you perform your actions...\" This doesn't restrict based on type of action (e.g., second action, normal action, or otherwise), supporting (in my mind) the approach we use.<br/>2) I think that this only applies to victorious battles. Under the glossary entry for Battle, points b&i, only surviving agents and repressed tokens are explicitly noted for placement after a battle. I'm not aware of anywhere in the rules that suggests or shows that defenders can be redistributed after a battle.<br/>3) I think that in theory, yes you are allowed to trigger a battle without any attackers, however, per my response to your question #2 I don't see how it is functionally different from not triggering a battle in that case (i.e., why you would do it)."

I don't believe these have really been asked online before.<br/><br/>1) I actually thought I asked this somewhere in the FAQ for 1e, but reviewing it, I don't see this particular case addressed. But it definitely matters, say if you play The Last Sigh as your second action, can you do take advantage of it in the same turn? I have always played it a certain way, but I don't have an answer for you here.<br/><br/>2) Well, you can't re-arrange tokens on a map card*. The only exceptions to this are Constantinople and Venice (when the Condottieri ability is active) during a regime change. So I believe what you're asking is can you trigger a losing one-shot against Ottoman and re-arrange Constantinople? For example, a 1-agent peasant revolt against a fully defended Ottoman. The rules only cite game steps and processes with regards to victorious attackers, never for the defenders. It can probably be assumed that victorious defenders uphold the status quo. See the glossary entries for Battle and Regime Change.<br/><br/>*There is kind of a workaround to re-arrange tokens on map cards.  Emancipated tokens can be placed in any open city during a regime change. So if you pair a knight/rook repress op with the Vote op, you can take pieces off the map using the Repress op and then place the repressed tokens into any open city you like when you Vote that empire."

The glossary entry seems not to have been updated from 1st edition where the ability was \"During your \"perform west ops\" action, you may perform one political op in a foreign tableau.\" See <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/image/6042433/prancingpwny\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"postlink\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">this image</a> for a side-by-side comparison of the 1st and 2nd edition cards.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Oh my gosh, about 2) I knew I had read it directly somewhere, and it was in tiny font as a tip in admist some examples... brilliant Van, thank you! <img class=\"emoticon\" src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /> I must say not the easiest rulebook sometimes, though on the whole pretty good. Plus I really like a lot of the art and the look of the whole 2e game. Yunno what though I wish they had used more art by Josefin Strand, like it is nice they give you 2 big pictures with the game box, but there are big empty spaces in the rule books, they would have looked good with art in them in my aesthetic opinion! ;0)"

In that case, to prevent the creation of big suzerains with lots of vassals which are too strong to be defeated, there could be an operation which would first detach a vassal from the suzerain, and the empire square would only change the owner if a regime change occurs to it and it is not a vassal anymore.

Repressed tokens <i>may</i> optionally be emancipated after a campaign, but that is at the player's discretion.<br/><br/>Regarding the glossary entry for \"Battle\": 1) you are correct it has a typo‚Äîit should say \"must be placed in the conquered Empire (until it is Saturated)\" (not \"Empire Square\"), and 2) the reason that it doesn't contradict F9i is that neither agents nor repressed tokens participate in campaigns. F9b states that \"All Knights (of every color) in the King's Location are the Attackers.\" (Agents specifically refers to tokens introduced by cards when played).<br/><br/>The campaign op example on page 25 of the rules is a good example of both how attackers don't move and tokens can be emancipated after a successful campaign."

You are correct that Agent pieces only count as Agents during one-shots and/or up until placement but are thereafter considered Tokens (the glossary defines Agents as Chess pieces depicted on cards and Tokens as any of the wooden chess or ship pieces on the Map and Tableau, subtly indicating the shift in status). Said another way, there is no connection between Tokens after placement and how they were placed. <br/><br/>This is in part, I imagine, thematic and in part mechanical‚Äîthose knights that are in place have to obey their king, whether or not the king is puppet to a different master or not and it would be complicated (with little benefit) to track which Tokens on the board were placed by cards vs. those resulting from levies or emancipation etc. In your campaign example, how do you know which of those knights were agents and which started on the map or resulted from a levy? It is clear which pieces are Agents since they are only Agents for resolving a one shot during the time the card is played (or simply to place the pieces onto the map).<br/><br/>The concept of played pieces being independent of how they were placed is mentioned in the rules: <font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>pg 17 of 2nd ed rules wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i> <b>Easily Missed:</b> Once played, cards and their Agents are independent of each other. If you target a card already in a Tableau, the Agent Tokens placed when the card was put in the Tableau are unaffected. If you target Agent Tokens, the card that originally generated the Agents is unaffected. You do not keep track of which cards deployed which Tokens. [E4a-e]</i></div></div></font> Using \"Agent Tokens\" as a term here is slightly confusing but I think the idea is clear that once pieces are placed they are simply Tokens‚Äîand any player can use them for their bidding.<br/><br/>"

As far I know:<br/>1. There is Vote op - unlimited in number of uses way of reducing number of Theocracies (and it is guaranteed to be in each game- there are empire squares with vote) <br/>2. Holy Conspiracy Rule that would  allow introducing Theocracy during some Conspiracy one-shots  was in some versions 2nd edition rulebook for some time but won't be introduced in final rules.<br/>3.  Holy war  One-shots  remain the only way of introducing a theocracy but are limited by random deck setup and (usually) only usable once when played. <br/>And there will be 11 (?) more apostasies one-shots that make playing with religious prestige more risky.<br/><br/>So will Holy Victory be significantly harder to achieve in 2nd edition than in was 1st edition ? <br/><br/>OTOH, While teaching and playing the first edition, it seemed somewhat strange, that campaign ops from theocracy never resulted in map change.<br/>"

Repress a piece or victourious conspiracy with Black Agent(s) on a christian theocracy, or vice-versa... üòÄ<br/>IMHO, as per the rules state now, that new way of creating a theocratic state (Holy conspiracy) could happen with literally every conspiracy: it doesn't need anything else to trigger than the conspiracy's succes & the will of the player.....  It isn't bad per-se, but I like the way it works in 1st ed: the rarity of the emergence of theocratic state, & the specific need for religious war. <br/>As stated now in living rules, every conspiracy could be a religious war, with quite equal chance of succes than a \"real\" religious war. I kinda feel that it could change the balance of the game, tilting toward religious victory, with the appearance of theocratical states almost everywhere! <br/>Moreover i find really un-thematic that a piece that is more enclined to support a certain religion, could participate in the elevation of another religion (why would you need to point out its religious affection in 1 st place then?).... nice if it could be a rare oddity, but as written now, I can see it happen a lot in every game.<br/> I like the idea that conspiracy could create theocracy though.... what do you think of my proposition?"

It's a closed economy because they're not leaving anywhere.<br/><br/>I can't speak for the \"why\" of Renaissance, but I'm guessing the thematic intent is that paying coins -- repressing people, confiscating taxes, and paying armies to stomp around and destroy things -- aren't creating more wealth and prosperity in Europe, but causing a net loss.<br/><br/>You're not directly sending the money to China, but in a roundabout way it's eventually going in that direction because the demand for eastern trade isn't gonna stop. So the kingdoms are paying to replace what they lost in the destructive wars."

Money is pumped into the European economy. <br/><br/>Things like levies and campaigns drain money out of the system. China is merely a convenient placeholder for this. <br/><br/>I embarrassed myself in the playtest by thinking that levies take money out of the economic system. This was my original Design intent, but it abandoned early in development. A detail I forgot. The game designer has a special disadvantage playing his own game, because all the design possibilities are still swirling in his head. I call this the Banks syndrome, for fellow game designer Bill Banks, who first identified it to me. <br/><br/>The original design goal was that all money in the game would be generated in the oriental trade. Under feudalism, cash was quite rare. The nobles squeezed food from the serfs, not money. The armies were conscriptees. Specialists were uncommon. <br/><br/>Bankers changed all that, and transformed Europe into a cash society dominated by merchants. <br/><br/>As an aside, I am writing this is a line a couple of blocks long, with the other immigrants trying to get a Swedish ID. With patience, I will become an official resident of Stockholm. "

From the update living rule:\n<br/>\n<br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>CRYPTOGRAPHY - The ‚ÄúMedici Ciphers Broken‚Äù Ability allows you to perform, once per game during your turn, one additional Op using a card from an opponent‚Äôs west Tableau, exactly as if that card was in your Tableau. The Op must be a political (purple) Op, so you gain a behead, tax, repress, or vote Op.  The card retains all its limitations (e.g. cannot behead itself, can be silenced, etc.). The card retains its Location, so the Op occurs in the Location of the card stolen from. \n<br/>\n<br/>Example: Your opponent has a coronated pair in Spain including Isabella of Castille, who has a Behead Op.  You use Cryptography on Isabel to murder her husband and send the Empire back to its king slot. </i></div></div></font>\n<br/>\n<br/>But I wonder about using the ability once per game? Not once per turn / op in the west?\n<br/>Maybe if so, wouldn't it be easier to trigger this ability once per game when you sell the card in your tableau? \"A la Machivelli\"? \n<br/>I wonder if it triggered only once per game though, it would actually be a good card.\n<br/>Thanks for this great game & the graphical improvments shown so far!!"

Of course, this is extremely powerful since Cryptography itself would not get discarded for causing an Empire to be beheaded. Hence, the \"once per game\" restriction."

Thanks for your answer!! <br/>I appreciate the change, thematically-wise, as i wrote on another thread in the expansion forum (see spoiler).<br/>Actually, I think that Phil has changed the rules, to allow it once per op. I don't think it would lead to a mass murder thing, as there is not so many Behead ops on the Western side.... Moreover, it is one more level to track if limited once per game (have I used this ability already?)<br/>Yet, I wonder, again thematically-wise, why this card should be restricted to the West part of stealing op.<br/><br/>[o]<font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>anthophe wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>Hi all!!<br/>I am by no means an expert of this game, nor a designer, but I find that its beauty resides in its theme-driven mechanisms.<br/>To answer these questions about Cryptography, I'd rather get back to the essence of the game, in which we're bankers pulling the strings... <br/>As I see it, when a card joins your tableau, the agent becomes sort of an \"employee\" of yours, providing you with the ability to run the ops they can. Yet, the game doesn't show up the fee you have to pay your bribed employees (say, whenever you ask them to provide you with a little service, like \"beheading\"). Reason is: it is so small in comparison to the amount you've needed to deploy them & execute their one-shot schemes, the game doesn't cover it.<br/>By playing the card \"Cryptography\", you then \"employ\" a team of cryptographs (located in the Papal States), able to break the secret code other bankers use to transmit their order to the \"employees\" of their own. Therefore, using cryptography means you send yourself the order to the aforementioned agents, through the code of their real \"boss\", to execute your own ploys, & the agent himself is deceived & believing it's their true employer that sent them that order...<br/><br/>So, when you use cryptography, you use the ops of a foreign tableau card (being West or East), as if it were in your own tableau! <br/><b>As such, it is the location of the foreign card that is used for the op, it is silenced by a bishop, it can't behead itself, and if it beheads an empire card, then it must be discarded, but not the Cryptography. </b><br/><br/>I know, Phil Eklund had written quite the opposite somewhere else, but that's the way we play this card, as it makes more sense thematically!!<br/>Take care in these hard times & have fun with this great game!!</i></div></div></font><br/>[/o]"
