    "Test Description": "Testing tile validity",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Testing basic (positive) validity of tile placement",
    "Question": "How many different spots can the new domino be validly placed in the kingdom? (assume different, valid, orientations of the new domino count as the same placement)",
    "Answer": "0 spots",
    "Rationale": "Blue is not compatible with any other existing tiles other than the castle which is wild. However, the castle is only diagonally open, every orthogonal spot is already occupied by a tile. Therefore, there are no valid placements for the new domino.",
