    "Test Description": "Testing turn order perception.",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Testing the ability to distinguish turn order for a game round. Note, there are a set of horizontal tests where you need to resolve the ambiguity using intuition about the relative strength of the tiles (this requires some intuition that could be gleaned from the rules).",
    "Question": "Which player will place third in the next round?",
    "Answer": "Green",
    "Rationale": "Green. The green forest is the top-most tile. This is not immediately clear as the picture is horizontal. However, we can resolve this by referring to the rulebook demonstrations and some intuition about the game drafting. Namely, the tiles all have a value assigned to them and are ordered by this value when laid out. The person at the top of the tile gets to draft first, therefore, intuitively, the top tile is the weakest. The player essentially has to choose between turn order in the future, and immediate value when selecting their next card.",
