  "Question": "What is the maximum number of on-component essences the player could have after two more actions. Assume all other players have passed. Output the answer as: Previous amount: <num>, New amount: <num>",
  "Answer": "Previous amount: 2, New amount: 2",
  "Rationale": "There are two life essences on Sacred Grove. The only way to add more is to have a creature card that can be turned. However, the player has none, and has no immediate access to them. Therefore, the max amount is still two.",
