  "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing this new game state on card-tapping combinations.",
  "Question": "Assume all other players have already passed. Given this game state, what is the maximum net number of essences the player can gain to their pool in two actions? Output the answer as: Previous essence amount: <num>, New essence amount: <num>",
  "Answer": "Previous essence count: 9, New essence count: 17",
  "Rationale": "It's ideal to use the second sacrificial pit power to destroy earth dragon to get 7 essences. To do this, they need to spend a death, which requires discarding a card for two essences. So, +7, +2, -1 = +8",
