  "Difficulty Notes": "Optimizing the number of resources obtained in X number of actions",
  "Question": "What is the maximum guaranteed number of victory points the player could have after 3 more actions, and what is the maximum number of essences they could have in their pool after these actions. Assume all other players have passed. Output the answer as: Previous VP amount: <num>, New VP amount: <num>, Previous essence count <num>, New essence count <num>",
  "Answer": "Previous VP amount: 5, New VP amount: 8, Previous essence count: 14, New essence count: 5",
  "Rationale": "Player could get two VPs by purchasing a monument card with four gold, however there is nothing they can do with their remaining resources to obtain another VP card. However, they could obtain coral castle to gain 3 VP. They are currently short on several essences. However, they could activate the top Sacred Grove power to generate 5 more life at the cost of one calm. Then, they could discard a card and gain one life and one elan essence, gaining enough for the 5x calm/elan/life cost for the coral castle. For essence count, player nets 2 from card discard, 4 from activating sacred grove, and loses 15 from purchasing coral castle. This nets -9 essences.",
