  "Difficulty Notes": "Optimizing the number of resources obtained in X number of actions",
  "Question": "Assume this is the state before the upcoming round starts. What is the maximum guaranteed number of victory points the player could have after taking their first three actions? Assume all other players will pass immediately and that you go last in turn order. Output the answer as: Previous amount: <num>, New amount: <num>",
  "Answer": "Previous amount: 5, New amount: 8",
  "Rationale": "At the start of the round, take the gold essence off of the vault artifact. Then, claim oracle with the first action. For second action, activate sacred grove power two to score one more point from the on-component essence. There isn't a good way to use a third action, as this is insufficient for obtaining the coral castle",
