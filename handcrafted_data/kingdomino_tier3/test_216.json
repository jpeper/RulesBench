    "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning. Testing placement if we are concerned about boundary violations (5x5 grid).",
    "Question": "Which domino should the player add to their kingdom to maximize its score? Output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
    "Answer": "Domino: C, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 12",
    "Rationale": "Domino C can be placed on the top as there is one remaining row. It contains a wheat crow, expanding the wheat score from 1x3 to 2x4 for an increase of 5 points. No other domino placement achieves this.",
