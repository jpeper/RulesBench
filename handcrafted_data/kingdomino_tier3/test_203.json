    "Test Description": "Assess basic optimization problems using small set of tiles.",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on a subset of the score optimization problems. This time, giving it a score and asking it to derive the solution",
    "Question": "Select two tiles from among the eight to combine together. One must contain a one-crown lake half. Subject to this, your goal is to optimize the scoring from the non-lake squares when combined. Follow normal scoring and connection rules. Output as 'Dominoes: [<tile 1 name>, <tile 2 name>], Non-lake score: <scalar>]",
    "Answer": "Dominoes: [G, E], Non-lake score: 2]",
    "Rationale": "Given the criteria, we must include either domino C or G. Given C only contains blue and yellow, (and yellow has no crowns), we may as well select G. Given G, we can maximize scoring by selecting E, as they combine for 2 forest points (2x1)",
