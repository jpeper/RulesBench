    "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over multiple steps of domino selection and placement. I add a note about adversarial player involvement.",
    "Difficulty Notes": "This example intentionally has no player interaction as green player is uninterrupted. Other challenging versions may include player interaction. Note: the current player being green is inferred from the text in the game state. The note about player involvement could potentially impact the outputs.",
    "Question": "What next domino should the player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act adversarially and will seek to minimize your score.",
    "Answer": "Domino: H, Previous kingdom score: 2, New kingdom score: 9",
    "Rationale": "Green player selected a double grasslands domino (A) in the prior round. We can pair this with the existing grasslands on the left side of their kingdom. By selecting domino H, we can add a crown to this section, improving its scoring from 0x4 to 1x7",
