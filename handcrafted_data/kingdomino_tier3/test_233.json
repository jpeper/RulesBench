    "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over multiple steps of domino selection and placement",
    "Difficulty Notes": "This example has some interaction and requires multi-step planning. It does not test any particular rules.",
    "Question": "What next domino should the blue player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you must take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act adversarially and will seek to minimize your score first and foremost before optimizing theirs.",
    "Answer": "Domino: F, Previous kingdom score: 2, New kingdom score: 6.",
    "Rationale": "Yellow picks last, so the other players will choose any dominos containing synergizing crowns. F has no crowns nor any spaces that are compatible with yellow's existing swamp crown. The only points yellow will net are from the selection in the prior round (domino C, which adds 4 net points)",
