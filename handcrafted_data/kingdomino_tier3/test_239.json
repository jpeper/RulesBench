    "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over multiple steps of domino selection and placement",
    "Question": "What next domino should the blue player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act adversarially and will seek to minimize your score first and foremost before optimizing theirs. We are playing with the harmony and middle kingdom rules.",
    "Answer": "Domino: F, Previous kingdom score: 17, New kingdom score: 33",
    "Rationale": "Blue goes third, so we have to assume the former players will take the two best tiles to stop us. There are already 17 points. Since we are playing with the harmony and middle kingdom rules we should pay special attention to those modifiers. We only have two tiles left to place, so the harmony variant is not applicable as we can't complete the 5x5 grid. However, we can get an extra 10 points if we play below the current bottom row in order to center the castle. Any alternative strategy must net +10 points over this strategy. Blue is getting the yellow crown tile (tile C) from the former turn, which could net 2-3 points depending on placement. The best tile is the grasslands one (H) given the quantity in the kingdom already. The second best is forest (G) since it would have 1x5 points. Therefore, the blue player will need to select domino F as they can synergize with two wheat fields, and this is better than the crown-free E. This nets 3x5 grasslands + 2x1 swamps + 2x3 wheat fields + 10 bonus points = 33 points",
