    "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over multiple steps of domino selection and placement",
    "Question": "What next domino should the yellow player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act adversarially and will seek to minimize your score first and foremost before optimizing theirs. We are playing with the harmony and middle kingdom rules.",
    "Answer": "Domino: E, Previous kingdom score: 17, New kingdom score: 30",
    "Rationale": "There are already 17 points. Since we are playing with the harmony and middle kingdom rules we should pay special attention to those modifiers. We only have two tiles left to place, so the harmony variant is not applicable as we can't complete the 5x5 grid. However, we can get an extra 10 points if we play below the current bottom row in order to center the castle. Any alternative strategy must net +10 points over this strategy. Yellow is getting a grassland and crowned-swamp domino from the former round (D). We would be tempted to place this at the top to synergize with the existing crowns, however this ignores the 10 point bonus for centering the kingdom. Given the other 3 players go before us and are picking to minimize our score, we are stuck with the worst tile. This is E, as it is crownless and contributes to no existing crown synergies. Our resultant score would be 3x6 + 2x1 + 10 = 30",
