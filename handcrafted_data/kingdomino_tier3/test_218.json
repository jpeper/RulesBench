    "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning.",
    "Question": "What are the most optimal kingdom scores that each of the four possible dominos could add to the player's kingdom if placed? For each domino, output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
    "Answer": "[[Domino: A, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 7], [Domino: B, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 7], [Domino: C, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 12], [Domino: D, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 11]]",
    "Rationale": "Options A and B don't add any crowns nor do they contribute to a currently-scoring area. Domino C can be placed on the top as there is one remaining row. It contains a wheat crow, expanding the wheat score from 1x3 to 2x4 for an increase of 5 points. Placing Domino D above the existing swamp tile would increase that region from 2x1 points to 3x2 meaning a 4 point gain.",
