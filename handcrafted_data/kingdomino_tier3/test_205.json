    "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning.",
    "Question": "Which is the second-best domino the player could add to their kingdom to maximize its score? Output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
    "Answer": "Domino: C, Previous kingdom score: 3, New kingdom score: 7",
    "Rationale": "Domino D scores three points simply from having a three-crown mine. Additionally, it can be placed under the one-crown wheat/forest tile, which connects it to the other two wheat fields. Domino C could net 4 new points if placed to connect the same wheat fields with domino D. However, the one-crown lake square on C only nets 1 point, instead of the 3 from the black mine in D.",
