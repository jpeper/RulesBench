    "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over sequential reasoning.'",
    "Difficulty Notes": "This example has some interaction and requires multi-step planning. It tests if the methods try to score *across* the castle without direct adjacency.",
    "Question": "What next domino should the blue player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act cooperatively and will take actions to best-support maximizing your score.",
    "Answer": "Domino: H, Previous kingdom score: 11, New kingdom score: 19",
    "Rationale": "Previous domino (B) contains both lake and wheat field synergies which is interesting. Ideally it should place in the top left to synergize there. The next domino should be H which can combine with the three unaffiliated forest tiles on the right. This will net 1x3 + 1x2 + 1x1 + 3x3 + 1x4 = 19",
