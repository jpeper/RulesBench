    "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over multiple steps of domino selection and placement",
    "Difficulty Notes": "What next domino should the pink player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act cooperatively and will take actions to best-support maximizing your score. We are playing with the harmony and middle kingdom rules.",
    "Answer": "Domino: H, Previous kingdom score: 17, New kingdom score: 36",
    "Rationale": "There are already 17 points. Since we are playing with the harmony and middle kingdom rules we should pay special attention to those modifiers. We only have two tiles left to place, so the harmony variant is not applicable as we can't complete the 5x5 grid. However, we can get an extra 10 points if we play below the current bottom row in order to center the castle. Any alternative strategy must net +10 points over this strategy. Pink selected the double lake tile in the prior round, which won't have any scoring effect. We should place below to get +10, and should see if there is anything else we can use to score points. This would be tile H, which yields another grasslands crown. With this tile, the green player will now get 4x6 for the grasslands + 2x1 for the swamp + 10 for the middle kingdom rule, netting 36 points.",
