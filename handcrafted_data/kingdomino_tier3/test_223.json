    "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning.",
    "Question": "Which is the second-best domino the player could add to their kingdom to maximize its score? Output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
    "Answer": "Domino: D, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 5",
    "Rationale": "Domino D doesn't combo well with any other tiles that are already on the board and adjacent to an empty space. E.g. the two-crown swamp square. Because of this, we just place it near existing green fields and score 1 point for it.",
