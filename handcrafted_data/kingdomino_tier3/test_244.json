    "Test Description": "Assessing ability to optimally plan over sequential reasoning.'",
    "Difficulty Notes": "This example has some interaction and requires multi-step planning. It tests if the methods try to score *across* the castle without direct adjacency.",
    "Question": "What next domino should the green player select to maximize the score of their kingdom? Assume the game ends after placement of the pictured dominos. Output the following: Domino letter, 'Previous kingdom score', eventual 'New kingdom score' after placement of all of the shown/selected draftable dominos. If necessary, you may take/simulate other players' actions for them. You should assume that the other players will act cooperatively and will take actions to best-support maximizing your score.",
    "Answer": "Domino: H, Previous kingdom score: 11, New kingdom score: 44",
    "Rationale": "Previous domino (A) isn't able to connect the sides, but will help one of the lake clusters. H will add scoring. This will net 1x1 + 2x2 + 5x3 = 20 points",
