    "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning.",
    "Question": "What are the most optimal kingdom scores that each of the four possible dominos could add to the player's kingdom if placed? For each domino, output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
    "Answer": "[[Domino: A, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 4], [Domino: B, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 4], [Domino: C, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 6], [Domino: D, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 5]]",
    "Rationale": "Domino C can be place in the bottom right, connecting the wheat field w/ a crown to the empty wheat field, yielding an improvment of 0x1 to 1x2. Domino D doesn't combo well with any other tiles that are already on the board and adjacent to an empty space. E.g. the two-crown swamp square. Because of this, we just place it near existing green fields and score 1 point for it.",
