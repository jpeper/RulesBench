    "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning.",
    "Question": "What are the most optimal kingdom scores that each of the four possible dominos could add to the player's kingdom if placed? For each domino, output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
    "Answer": "[[Domino: A, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 4], [Domino: B, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 4], [Domino: C, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 10], [Domino: D, Previous kingdom score: 4, New kingdom score: 7]]",
    "Rationale": "The first two dominos (A and B) don't have any crown compatibility therefore they contribute zero points. Domino D would add 3 points from the lakes -- (1x3) instead of (0x2). Domino C would add 6 points for wheat fields -- (2x4) instead of (1x2)",
