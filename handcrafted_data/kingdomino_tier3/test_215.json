    "Test Description": "Assess one-hop optimization -- selecting the best tile to add to the current game state",
    "Difficulty Notes": "Focusing on very easy scenarios for now, where there is just one or two hops of reasoning.",
    "Question": "What are the most optimal kingdom scores that each of the four possible dominos could add to the player's kingdom if placed? For each domino, output the following: Domino letter, Previous kingdom score, new kingdom score.",
    "Answer": "[[Domino: A, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 7], [Domino: B, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 12], [Domino: C, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 9], [Domino: D, Previous kingdom score: 7, New kingdom score: 8]]",
    "Rationale": "Options A and B don't add any crowns nor do they contribute to a currently-scoring area. Domino C would add 2 points from the wheat field -- (1x2) instead of (0x1). Domino D simple adds a single swamp crown to the board, netting one more point.",
